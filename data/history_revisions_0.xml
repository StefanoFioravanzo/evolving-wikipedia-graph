      <text xml:space="preserve">''Anarchism'' is the political theory that advocates the abolition of all forms of government. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).



Different groups have radically different understandings of what the abolition of governments would entail: &quot;[[libertarian socialism|Libertarian socialists]]&quot; are convinced it means a collectivist economy; &quot;[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]&quot; are convinced it means capitalism; &quot;[[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]]&quot; don't know or don't care as much about such issues, but insist above all on individual freedom from state.



=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===

This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, notably with collective ownership of means of production, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].



Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves '[[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]]' or 'left anarchists', to distinguish themselves from anarcho-capitalists. However, the mere word 'anarchist' popularly denote this brand of anarchists.



Libertarian socialism traces its tradition back to the eighteenth (can anyone give any reference???) and nineteenth centuries (see Proudhon, Kropotkin, Bakunin, etc.).



Few left-anarchists are actually violent, but throughout the late 19th and early 20th century, the violent kind has made &quot;anarchism&quot; famous as an ideology justifying murder and bombing. Most left-anarchists are not immediately violent, although many advocate a future revolution. The position of left-anarchists regarding violence, what legitimizes it or not, and how can justice exist with or without violence is not clear, though.



=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===

The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.



Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves '[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]'.



Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.



Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.



=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===

There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.



Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches rather than collectivism. They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.



On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail, as long as individual freedom is respected.



=== Anarchy ([[Anomy]]) ===

The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what scholars call &quot;anomy&quot; (absence of order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.



This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomy has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].



=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===

Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.



Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, which constitutes a de facto government, and should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider that an employer-employee relationship is an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is a form of oppressive de facto government.



Libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists view each other with hostility. Proponents of each of these two theories tend to claim that theirs is the only true anarchism, while the other position is not anarchism at all, because it opposes a wrong notion of power ('archos'). On the other hand, libertarian socialists consider themselves as part of the collectivist movement, while anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as classical liberals - this shows that the opposition between collectivism and individualism in matters of political economy is indeed more essential than the question of the existence of government.



Many libertarian socialists argue that anarcho-capitalism should not be called anarchism at all, due to the much older use of the word to refer to libertarian socialism. Anarcho-capitalists argue they have just as much right to the word as libertarian socialists have, and that their anti-statist tradition is actually older and more coherent. Individualist anarchists don't care much for such macho &quot;length contests&quot; about the age of traditions.



=== Historical Anarchist Movements ===



* [[Spanish Civil War]] - During the Spanish civil war, the anti-[[fascism|fascist]] forces were comprised of various factions including communists and anarchists. Anarchist groups controlled both territory and factories for a time during the war. Fights broke out between the communists and anarchist in some cities. One of the anarchist groups from that time, the CNT (Confederación National del Trabajo), still exists in Spain and has [http://www.cnt.es/ a website].



=== Most Famous Anarchists ===



Here is a small selection of most famous anarchists. For more, see in various categories.

* [[Michael Bakunin]] (1814 - 1876), well-known early [[libertarian socialism|socialist anarchist]]

* [[Gustave de Molinari]] (1819 - 1912), first theorist of [[anarcho-capitalism]]

* [[Benjamin Tucker]] (1854 - 1939), great defender of [[individualist anarchism]]



* [[Voltairine de Cleyre]] (1866 - 1912)

* [[Rudolph Rocker]] (1873 - 1958)

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Anarchism'' is the political theory that advocates the abolition of all forms of government. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).



Different groups have radically different understandings of what the abolition of governments would entail: &quot;[[libertarian socialism|Libertarian socialists]]&quot; are convinced it means a collectivist economy; &quot;[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]&quot; are convinced it means capitalism; &quot;[[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]]&quot; don't know or don't care as much about such issues, but insist above all on individual freedom from state.



=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===

This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, notably with collective ownership of means of production, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].



Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves '[[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]]' or 'left anarchists', to distinguish themselves from anarcho-capitalists. However, the mere word 'anarchist' popularly denote this brand of anarchists.



Libertarian socialism traces its tradition back to the eighteenth (can anyone give any reference???) and nineteenth centuries (see Proudhon, Kropotkin, Bakunin, etc.).



Few left-anarchists are actually violent, but throughout the late 19th and early 20th century, the violent kind has made &quot;anarchism&quot; famous as an ideology justifying murder and bombing. Most left-anarchists are not immediately violent, although many advocate a future revolution. The position of left-anarchists regarding violence, what legitimizes it or not, and how can justice exist with or without violence is not clear, though.



=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===

The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.



Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves '[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]'.



Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.





Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.



=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===

There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.



Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches rather than collectivism. They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.



On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail, as long as individual freedom is respected.



=== Anarchy ([[Anomy]]) ===

The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what scholars call &quot;anomy&quot; (absence of order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.



This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomy has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].



=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===

Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.



Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, which constitutes a de facto government, and should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider that an employer-employee relationship is an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is a form of oppressive de facto government.



Libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists view each other with hostility. Proponents of each of these two theories tend to claim that theirs is the only true anarchism, while the other position is not anarchism at all, because it opposes a wrong notion of power ('archos'). On the other hand, libertarian socialists consider themselves as part of the collectivist movement, while anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as classical liberals - this shows that the opposition between collectivism and individualism in matters of political economy is indeed more essential than the question of the existence of government.



Many libertarian socialists argue that anarcho-capitalism should not be called anarchism at all, due to the much older use of the word to refer to libertarian socialism. Anarcho-capitalists argue they have just as much right to the word as libertarian socialists have, and that their anti-statist tradition is actually older and more coherent. Individualist anarchists don't care much for such macho &quot;length contests&quot; about the age of traditions.



=== Historical Anarchist Movements ===



* [[Spanish Civil War]] - During the Spanish civil war, the anti-[[fascism|fascist]] forces were comprised of various factions including communists and anarchists. Anarchist groups controlled both territory and factories for a time during the war. Fights broke out between the communists and anarchist in some cities. One of the anarchist groups from that time, the CNT (Confederación National del Trabajo), still exists in Spain and has [http://www.cnt.es/ a website].

Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.


Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches rather than collectivism. They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail, as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy ([[Anomy]]) ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what scholars call &quot;anomy&quot; (absence of order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomy has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.

Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, which constitutes a de facto government, and should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider that an employer-employee relationship is an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is a form of oppressive de facto government.

Libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists view each other with hostility. Proponents of each of these two theories tend to claim that theirs is the only true anarchism, while the other position is not anarchism at all, because it opposes a wrong notion of power ('archos'). On the other hand, libertarian socialists consider themselves as part of the collectivist movement, while anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as classical liberals - this shows that the opposition between collectivism and individualism in matters of political economy is indeed more essential than the question of the existence of government.

Many libertarian socialists argue that anarcho-capitalism should not be called anarchism at all, due to the much older use of the word to refer to libertarian socialism. Anarcho-capitalists argue they have just as much right to the word as libertarian socialists have, and that their anti-statist tradition is actually older and more coherent. Individualist anarchists don't care much for such macho &quot;length contests&quot; about the age of traditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Anarchism'' is the political theory that advocates the abolition of all forms of government. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

Different groups have radically different understandings of what the abolition of governments would entail: &quot;[[libertarian socialism|Libertarian socialists]]&quot; are convinced it means a collectivist economy; &quot;[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]&quot; are convinced it means capitalism; &quot;[[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]]&quot; don't know or don't care as much about such issues, but insist above all on individual freedom from state.

These divisions are excarbated by a very polemical debate around the names of various types of anarchism and related ideas.  For example, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist.  In the United States, &quot;libertarianism&quot; typically does not refer to either anarchism or socialism, while in e.g. Latin America it refers to both.  Finally, the term &quot;anarchy&quot; is frequently used as a perjorative in reference to [[anomy]].

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, notably with collective ownership of means of production, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves '[[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]]' or 'left anarchists', to distinguish themselves from anarcho-capitalists. However, the mere word 'anarchist' popularly denote this brand of anarchists.

While some historians trace the roots of (European) anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Tolstoy]], [[Proudhon]], [[Kropotkin]], and [[Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), [[non-violence]], [[cooperativism]] and [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Bakunin]] was thrown out of the International by Karl [[Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes escalated into near-insurrections.  In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[regicide]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  President [[Mckinley]], among others, was assinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent.  In fact there is no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence among libertarian socialists.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violence]] is prevalent among many anarchists; others believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]]) is justified in reaction to what they see as oppression.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many Libertarian Socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] and [[cooperativism]].  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.


=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves '[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]'.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA.

Different groups have radically different understandings of what the abolition of governments would entail: &quot;[[libertarian socialism|Libertarian socialists]]&quot; are convinced it means a collectivist economy; &quot;[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]&quot; are convinced it means capitalism; &quot;[[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]]&quot; don't know or don't care as much about such issues, but insist above all on individual freedom from state.

These divisions are excarbated by a very polemical debate around the names of various types of anarchism and related ideas.  For example, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist.  In the United States, &quot;libertarianism&quot; typically does not refer to either anarchism or socialism, while in e.g. Latin America it refers to both.  Finally, the term &quot;anarchy&quot; is frequently used as a perjorative in reference to [[anomy]].

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, notably with collective ownership of means of production, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves '[[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]]' or 'left anarchists', to distinguish themselves from anarcho-capitalists. However, the mere word 'anarchist' popularly denote this brand of anarchists.

While some historians trace the roots of (European) anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Tolstoy]], [[Proudhon]], [[Kropotkin]], and [[Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), [[non-violence]], [[cooperativism]] and [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Bakunin]] was thrown out of the International by Karl [[Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes escalated into near-insurrections.  In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[regicide]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  President [[Mckinley]], among others, was assinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent.  In fact there is no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence among libertarian socialists.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violence]] is prevalent among many anarchists; others believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]]) is justified in reaction to what they see as oppression.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many Libertarian Socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] and [[cooperativism]].  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.


=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves '[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]'.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.


Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches rather than collectivism. They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail, as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy ([[Anomy]]) ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what scholars call &quot;anomy&quot; (absence of order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomy has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.

Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, which constitutes a de facto government, and should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider that an employer-employee relationship is an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is a form of oppressive de facto government.

Libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists view each other with hostility. Proponents of each of these two theories tend to claim that theirs is the only true anarchism, while the other position is not anarchism at all, because it opposes a wrong notion of power ('archos'). On the other hand, libertarian socialists consider themselves as part of the collectivist movement, while anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as classical liberals - this shows that the opposition between collectivism and individualism in matters of political economy is indeed more essential than the question of the existence of government.

Many libertarian socialists argue that anarcho-capitalism should not be called anarchism at all, due to the much older use of the word to refer to libertarian socialism. Anarcho-capitalists argue they have just as much right to the word as libertarian socialists have, and that their anti-statist tradition is actually older and more coherent. Individualist anarchists don't care much for such macho &quot;length contests&quot; about the age of traditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anarchism''' is the political theory that advocates the abolition of all forms of government. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

Different groups have radically different understandings of what the abolition of governments would entail: &quot;[[libertarian socialism|Libertarian socialists]]&quot; are convinced it means a collectivist economy; &quot;[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]&quot; are convinced it means capitalism; &quot;[[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]]&quot; don't know or don't care as much about such issues, but insist above all on individual freedom from state.

These divisions are excarbated by a very polemical debate around the names of various types of anarchism and related ideas.  For example, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist.  In the United States, &quot;libertarianism&quot; typically does not refer to either anarchism or socialism, while in e.g. Latin America it refers to both.  Finally, the term &quot;anarchy&quot; is frequently used as a perjorative in reference to [[anomy]].

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, notably with collective ownership of means of production, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves '[[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]]' or 'left anarchists', to distinguish themselves from anarcho-capitalists. However, the mere word 'anarchist' popularly denote this brand of anarchists.

While some historians trace the roots of (European) anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Tolstoy]], [[Proudhon]], [[Kropotkin]], and [[Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), [[non-violence]], [[cooperativism]] and [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Bakunin]] was thrown out of the International by Karl [[Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes escalated into near-insurrections.  In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[regicide]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  President [[Mckinley]], among others, was assinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent.  In fact there is no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence among libertarian socialists.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violence]] is prevalent among many anarchists; others believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]]) is justified in reaction to what they see as oppression.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many Libertarian Socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] and [[cooperativism]].  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.


=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves '[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]'.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.


Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches rather than collectivism. They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail, as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy ([[Anomy]]) ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what scholars call &quot;anomy&quot; (absence of order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomy has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.

Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, which constitutes a de facto government, and should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider that an employer-employee relationship is an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is a form of oppressive de facto government.

Libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists view each other with hostility. Proponents of each of these two theories tend to claim that theirs is the only true anarchism, while the other position is not anarchism at all, because it opposes a wrong notion of power ('archos'). On the other hand, libertarian socialists consider themselves as part of the collectivist movement, while anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as classical liberals - this shows that the opposition between collectivism and individualism in matters of political economy is indeed more essential than the question of the existence of government.

Many libertarian socialists argue that anarcho-capitalism should not be called anarchism at all, due to the much older use of the word to refer to libertarian socialism. Anarcho-capitalists argue they have just as much right to the word as libertarian socialists have, and that their anti-statist tradition is actually older and more coherent. Individualist anarchists don't care much for such macho &quot;length contests&quot; about the age of traditions.

=== Historical Anarchist Movements ===

* [[Spanish Civil War]] - During the Spanish civil war, the anti-[[fascism|fascist]] forces were comprised of various factions including communists and anarchists. Anarchist groups controlled both territory and factories for a time during the war. Fights broke out between the communists and anarchist in some cities. One of the anarchist groups from that time, the CNT (Confederación National del Trabajo), still exists in Spain and has [http://www.cnt.es/ a website].

All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.


Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches rather than collectivism. They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail, as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy ([[Anomy]]) ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what scholars call &quot;anomy&quot; (absence of order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomy has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.

Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, which constitutes a de facto government, and should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider that an employer-employee relationship is an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is a form of oppressive de facto government.

Libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists view each other with hostility. Proponents of each of these two theories tend to claim that theirs is the only true anarchism, while the other position is not anarchism at all, because it opposes a wrong notion of power ('archos'). On the other hand, libertarian socialists consider themselves as part of the collectivist movement, while anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as classical liberals - this shows that the opposition between collectivism and individualism in matters of political economy is indeed more essential than the question of the existence of government.

Many libertarian socialists argue that anarcho-capitalism should not be called anarchism at all, due to the much older use of the word to refer to libertarian socialism. Anarcho-capitalists argue they have just as much right to the word as libertarian socialists have, and that their anti-statist tradition is actually older and more coherent. Individualist anarchists don't care much for such macho &quot;length contests&quot; about the age of traditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anarchism''' is the political theory that advocates the abolition of all forms of government. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

Different groups have radically different understandings of what the abolition of governments would entail: &quot;[[libertarian socialism|Libertarian socialists]]&quot; are convinced it means a collectivist economy; &quot;[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]&quot; are convinced it means capitalism; &quot;[[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]]&quot; don't know or don't care as much about such issues, but insist above all on individual freedom from state.

These divisions are excarbated by a very polemical debate around the names of various types of anarchism and related ideas.  For example, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist.  In the United States, &quot;libertarianism&quot; typically does not refer to either anarchism or socialism, while in e.g. Latin America it refers to both.  Finally, the term &quot;anarchy&quot; is frequently used as a perjorative in reference to [[anomy]].

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, notably with collective ownership of means of production, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves '[[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]]' or 'left anarchists', to distinguish themselves from anarcho-capitalists. However, the mere word 'anarchist' popularly denote this brand of anarchists.

While some historians trace the roots of (European) anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Tolstoy]], [[Proudhon]], [[Kropotkin]], and [[Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), [[non-violence]], [[cooperativism]] and [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Bakunin]] was thrown out of the International by Karl [[Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes escalated into near-insurrections.  In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[regicide]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  President [[Mckinley]], among others, was assinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent.  In fact there is no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence among libertarian socialists.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violence]] is prevalent among many anarchists; others believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]]) is justified in reaction to what they see as oppression.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many Libertarian Socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] and [[cooperativism]].  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.


=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves '[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]'.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anarchism''' is the political theory that advocates the abolition of all forms of government. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

Different groups have radically different understandings of what the abolition of governments would entail: &quot;[[libertarian socialism|Libertarian socialists]]&quot; are convinced it means a collectivist economy; &quot;[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]&quot; are convinced it means capitalism; &quot;[[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]]&quot; don't know or don't care as much about such issues, but insist above all on individual freedom from state.

These divisions are excarbated by a very polemical debate around the names of various types of anarchism and related ideas.  For example, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist.  In the United States, &quot;libertarianism&quot; typically does not refer to either anarchism or socialism, while in e.g. Latin America it refers to both.  Finally, the term &quot;anarchy&quot; is frequently used as a perjorative in reference to [[anomy]].

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, notably with collective ownership of means of production, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves '[[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]]' or 'left anarchists', to distinguish themselves from anarcho-capitalists. However, the mere word 'anarchist' popularly denote this brand of anarchists.

While some historians trace the roots of (European) anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Proudhon]], [[PeterKropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), [[non-violence]], [[cooperativism]] and [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Bakunin]] was thrown out of the International by Karl [[Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes escalated into near-insurrections.  In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[regicide]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  President [[Mckinley]], among others, was assinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent.  In fact there is no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence among libertarian socialists.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violence]] is prevalent among many anarchists; others believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]]) is justified in reaction to what they see as oppression.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many Libertarian Socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] and [[cooperativism]].  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.


=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves '[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]'.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.


Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches rather than collectivism. They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy ([[Anomy]]) ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what scholars call &quot;anomy&quot; (absence of order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomy has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.

Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, which constitutes a de facto government, and should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider that an employer-employee relationship is an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is a form of oppressive de facto government.

Libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists view each other with hostility. Proponents of each of these two theories tend to claim that theirs is the only true anarchism, while the other position is not anarchism at all, because it opposes a wrong notion of power ('archos'). On the other hand, libertarian socialists consider themselves as part of the collectivist movement, while anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as classical liberals - this shows that the opposition between collectivism and individualism in matters of political economy is indeed more essential than the question of the existence of government.

Many libertarian socialists argue that anarcho-capitalism should not be called anarchism at all, due to the much older use of the word to refer to libertarian socialism. Anarcho-capitalists argue they have just as much right to the word as libertarian socialists have, and that their anti-statist tradition is actually older and more coherent.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.

Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, which constitutes a de facto government, and should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider that an employer-employee relationship is an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is a form of oppressive de facto government.

Libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists view each other with hostility. Proponents of each of these two theories tend to claim that theirs is the only true anarchism, while the other position is not anarchism at all, because it opposes a wrong notion of power ('archos'). On the other hand, libertarian socialists consider themselves as part of the collectivist movement, while anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as classical liberals - this shows that the opposition between collectivism and individualism in matters of political economy is indeed more essential than the question of the existence of government.

Many libertarian socialists argue that anarcho-capitalism should not be called anarchism at all, due to the much older use of the word to refer to libertarian socialism. Anarcho-capitalists argue they have just as much right to the word as libertarian socialists have, and that their anti-statist tradition is actually older and more coherent. Individualist anarchists could arguably claim &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; are the oldest anarchist tradition, but they care little for such macho &quot;length contests&quot; about the age of traditions, since they don't feel like they are part of a collective they must defend.

'''Anarchism''' is the political theory that advocates the abolition of all forms of government. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

Different groups have radically different understandings of what the abolition of governments would entail: &quot;[[libertarian socialism|Libertarian socialists]]&quot; are convinced it means a collectivist economy; &quot;[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]&quot; are convinced it means capitalism; &quot;[[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]]&quot; don't know or don't care as much about such issues, but insist above all on individual freedom from state.

These divisions are excarbated by a very polemical debate around the names of various types of anarchism and related ideas.  For example, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist.  In the United States, &quot;libertarianism&quot; typically does not refer to either anarchism or socialism, while in e.g. Latin America it refers to both.  Finally, the term &quot;anarchy&quot; is frequently used improperly as a perjorative in reference to [[anomie]].

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, notably with collective ownership of means of production, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves '[[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]]' or 'left anarchists', to distinguish themselves from anarcho-capitalists. However, the mere word 'anarchist' popularly denote this brand of anarchists.

While some historians trace the roots of (European) anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Proudhon]], [[PeterKropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), [[non-violence]], [[cooperativism]] and [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Bakunin]] was thrown out of the International by Karl [[Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes escalated into near-insurrections.  In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[regicide]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  President [[Mckinley]], among others, was assinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent.  In fact there is no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence among libertarian socialists.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violence]] is prevalent among many anarchists; others believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]]) is justified in reaction to what they see as oppression.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many Libertarian Socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] and [[cooperativism]].  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.


=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves '[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]'.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.


Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches rather than collectivism. They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.

Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, which constitutes a de facto government, and should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider that an employer-employee relationship is an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is a form of oppressive de facto government.

Libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists view each other with hostility. Proponents of each of these two theories tend to claim that theirs is the only true anarchism, while the other position is not anarchism at all, because it opposes a wrong notion of power ('archos'). On the other hand, libertarian socialists consider themselves as part of the collectivist movement, while anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as classical liberals - this shows that the opposition between collectivism and individualism in matters of political economy is indeed more essential than the question of the existence of government.

Many libertarian socialists argue that anarcho-capitalism should not be called anarchism at all, due to the much older use of the word to refer to libertarian socialism. Anarcho-capitalists argue they have just as much right to the word as libertarian socialists have, and that their anti-statist tradition is actually older and more coherent. Individualist anarchists could arguably claim &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; are the oldest anarchist tradition, but they care little for such macho &quot;length contests&quot; about the age of traditions, since they don't feel like they are part of a collective they must defend.

The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves '[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]'.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.


Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches rather than collectivism. They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.


On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.

Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, which constitutes a de facto government, and should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider that an employer-employee relationship is an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is a form of oppressive de facto government.

Libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists view each other with hostility. Proponents of each of these two theories tend to claim that theirs is the only true anarchism, while the other position is not anarchism at all, because it opposes a wrong notion of power ('archos'). On the other hand, libertarian socialists consider themselves as part of the collectivist movement, while anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as classical liberals - this shows that the opposition between collectivism and individualism in matters of political economy is indeed more essential than the question of the existence of government.

Many libertarian socialists argue that anarcho-capitalism should not be called anarchism at all, due to the much older use of the word to refer to libertarian socialism. Anarcho-capitalists argue they have just as much right to the word as libertarian socialists have, and that their anti-statist tradition is actually older and more coherent. Individualist anarchists could arguably claim &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; are the oldest anarchist tradition, but they care little for such macho &quot;length contests&quot; about the age of traditions, since they don't feel like they are part of a collective they must defend.

=== Historical Anarchist Movements ===

* [[Spanish Civil War]] - During the Spanish civil war, the anti-[[fascism|fascist]] forces were comprised of various factions including communists and anarchists. Anarchist groups controlled both territory and factories for a time during the war. Fights broke out between the communists and anarchist in some cities. One of the anarchist groups from that time, the CNT (Confederación National del Trabajo), still exists in Spain and has [http://www.cnt.es/ a website].

* [[Russian Revolution]] - After the overthrow of the czarist state, many revolutionary movements sprang up all throughout the collapsing Russian Empire. Notable amongst these was an anarchist peasant movement in the Ukraine, usually known as the Makhnovists due to the influence of [[Nestor Makhno]], an anarchist peasant/general. The Makhnovists organized resistance against the White counterrevolution, and later on against the consolidation of power by the Bolsheviks, but were eventually crushed.

* [[Mexican Revolution]] - The revolutionary period in Mexico was an extended period usually considered to have begun with the overthrow of the dictator [[Porfirio Diaz]] and the installation of the moderate [[Francisco Madero]]. Instrumental in this transfer of power were the likes of [[Pancho Villa]] and [[Emiliano Zapata]], a mestizo peasant from the state of Morelos. Zapata and his followers, the [[Zapatistas]], mostly [[Mayans|Mayan Indians]], advocated for a program of radical land reform under the slogan &quot;Tierra y Libertad&quot;, or &quot;Land and Liberty&quot;. This demand, laid out roughly in the Zapatista's Plan de Ayala, sought to break up the large landholdings (fincas) which maintained power in the hands of the landlords (finqueros) and kept the Indian peasants chained into a system of lifelong debt slavery (peonage). This Zapatista movement was eventually augmented by intellectuals from Mexico City, including the anarchist [[Antonio Diaz Soto Y Gama]] and the brothers Jesus and [[Ricardo Flores Magon]] (who coined the phrase &quot;Land &amp; Liberty&quot; that Zapata adopted). These intellectuals, more articulate than the illiterate peasants (probably including Zapata himself) became the voice for the Zapatista movement. Zapata quickly broke with Madero, who he felt was not moving quickly enough in the area of land reform, and continued to fight his government and the successive governments of [[Victoriano Huerta]] and [[Venustiano Carranza]]. Madero, Huerta and Carranza fought each other for control of the Mexican state, but all agreed that Zapata was a thorn that had to be removed. Eventually, after many years of fighting, Carranza succeeded in having Zapata assassinated (on April 10, 1917), and subduing the Zapatista forces.

'''Anarchism''' is the [[political]] theory that advocates the abolition of all forms of [[government]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

Different groups have radically different understandings of what the abolition of governments would entail: &quot;[[libertarian socialism|Libertarian socialists]]&quot; are convinced it means a collectivist economy; &quot;[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]&quot; are convinced it means capitalism; &quot;[[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]]&quot; don't know or don't care as much about such issues, but insist above all on individual freedom from state.

These divisions are excarbated by a very polemical debate around the names of various types of anarchism and related ideas.  For example, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist.  In the United States, &quot;libertarianism&quot; typically does not refer to either anarchism or socialism, while in e.g. Latin America it refers to both.  Finally, the term &quot;anarchy&quot; is frequently used improperly as a perjorative in reference to [[anomie]].

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, notably with collective ownership of means of production, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves '[[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]]' or 'left anarchists', to distinguish themselves from anarcho-capitalists. However, the mere word 'anarchist' popularly denote this brand of anarchists.

While some historians trace the roots of (European) anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Proudhon]], [[PeterKropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), [[non-violence]], [[cooperativism]] and [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Bakunin]] was thrown out of the International by Karl [[Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes escalated into near-insurrections.  In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[regicide]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  President [[Mckinley]], among others, was assinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent.  In fact there is no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence among libertarian socialists.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violence]] is prevalent among many anarchists; others believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]]) is justified in reaction to what they see as oppression.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many Libertarian Socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] and [[cooperativism]].  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

* [[IWW]] - The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW, or &quot;Wobblies&quot;) were an anarcho-syndicalist labor union that was prominent in labor struggles in early 20th century America. They advocated the formation of &quot;one big union&quot; comprised of all workers everywhere. The IWW made use of militant tactics in order to effect their demands for improvement in worker's conditions, including sabotage, and popularized the &quot;wildcat strike&quot;, a sudden, unannounced work stoppage, as a means of fighting. While they never advocated straight out violence, they were clear in their intent to defend themselves if attacked, and fought back with force against policemen and Pinkerton security guards. The Wobblies were unabashedly revolutionary (as many labor unions were at the time) and saw their struggle for worker's rights only as a tool towards the eventual worker takeover of factories that the syndicalists envisioned at the time. They were racially inclusive, recognizing that black workers and white workers faced the same oppression (in a time when many labor unions were exclusive). They faced fierce resistance, both from the bosses themselves and from the federal government. This resistance, and the slow process of attrition of revolutionary potential as labor unions forced concessions from the capitalists, reduced the IWW to tatters by the early twenties. They still survive in some form and are organizing workers to this day. Their website is [http://www.iww.org here].

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.

Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, which constitutes a de facto government, and should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider that an employer-employee relationship is an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is a form of oppressive de facto government.

Libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists view each other with hostility. Proponents of each of these two theories tend to claim that theirs is the only true anarchism, while the other position is not anarchism at all, because it opposes a wrong notion of power ('archos'). On the other hand, libertarian socialists consider themselves as part of the collectivist movement, while anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as classical liberals - this shows that the opposition between collectivism and individualism in matters of political economy is indeed more essential than the question of the existence of government.

Many libertarian socialists argue that anarcho-capitalism should not be called anarchism at all, due to the much older use of the word to refer to libertarian socialism. Anarcho-capitalists argue they have just as much right to the word as libertarian socialists have, and that their anti-statist tradition is actually older and more coherent. Individualist anarchists could arguably claim &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; are the oldest anarchist tradition, but they care little for such macho &quot;length contests&quot; about the age of traditions, since they don't feel like they are part of a collective they must defend.

=== Historical Anarchist Movements ===

* [[Spanish Civil War]] - During the Spanish civil war, the anti-[[fascism|fascist]] forces were comprised of various factions including communists and anarchists. Anarchist groups controlled both territory and factories for a time during the war. Fights broke out between the communists and anarchist in some cities. One of the anarchist groups from that time, the CNT (Confederación National del Trabajo), still exists in Spain and has [http://www.cnt.es/ a website].

* [[Russian Revolution]] - After the overthrow of the czarist state, many revolutionary movements sprang up all throughout the collapsing Russian Empire. Notable amongst these was an anarchist peasant movement in the Ukraine, usually known as the Makhnovists due to the influence of [[Nestor Makhno]], an anarchist peasant/general. The Makhnovists organized resistance against the White counterrevolution, and later on against the consolidation of power by the Bolsheviks, but were eventually crushed.

* [[Mexican Revolution]] - The revolutionary period in Mexico was an extended period usually considered to have begun with the overthrow of the dictator [[Porfirio Diaz]] and the installation of the moderate [[Francisco Madero]]. Instrumental in this transfer of power were the likes of [[Pancho Villa]] and [[Emiliano Zapata]], a mestizo peasant from the state of Morelos. Zapata and his followers, the [[Zapatistas]], mostly [[Mayans|Mayan Indians]], advocated for a program of radical land reform under the slogan &quot;Tierra y Libertad&quot;, or &quot;Land and Liberty&quot;. This demand, laid out roughly in the Zapatista's Plan de Ayala, sought to break up the large landholdings (fincas) which maintained power in the hands of the landlords (finqueros) and kept the Indian peasants chained into a system of lifelong debt slavery (peonage). This Zapatista movement was eventually augmented by intellectuals from Mexico City, including the anarchist [[Antonio Diaz Soto Y Gama]] and the brothers Jesus and [[Ricardo Flores Magon]] (who coined the phrase &quot;Land &amp; Liberty&quot; that Zapata adopted). These intellectuals, more articulate than the illiterate peasants (probably including Zapata himself) became the voice for the Zapatista movement. Zapata quickly broke with Madero, who he felt was not moving quickly enough in the area of land reform, and continued to fight his government and the successive governments of [[Victoriano Huerta]] and [[Venustiano Carranza]]. Madero, Huerta and Carranza fought each other for control of the Mexican state, but all agreed that Zapata was a thorn that had to be removed. Eventually, after many years of fighting, Carranza succeeded in having Zapata assassinated (on April 10, 1917), and subduing the Zapatista forces.

* [[IWW]] - The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW, or &quot;Wobblies&quot;) were an anarcho-syndicalist labor union that was prominent in labor struggles in early 20th century America. They advocated the formation of &quot;one big union&quot; comprised of all workers everywhere. The IWW made use of militant tactics in order to effect their demands for improvement in worker's conditions, including sabotage, and popularized the &quot;wildcat strike&quot;, a sudden, unannounced work stoppage, as a means of fighting. While they never advocated straight out violence, they were clear in their intent to defend themselves if attacked, and fought back with force against policemen and Pinkerton security guards. The Wobblies were unabashedly revolutionary (as many labor unions were at the time) and saw their struggle for worker's rights only as a tool towards the eventual worker takeover of factories that the syndicalists envisioned at the time. They were racially inclusive, recognizing that black workers and white workers faced the same oppression (in a time when many labor unions were exclusive). They faced fierce resistance, both from the bosses themselves and from the federal government. This resistance, and the slow process of attrition of revolutionary potential as labor unions forced concessions from the capitalists, reduced the IWW to tatters by the early twenties. They still survive in some form and are organizing workers to this day. Their website is [http://www.iww.org here].

'''Anarchism''' is the [[political]] theory that advocates the abolition of all forms of [[government]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

Different groups have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean an abolition of all forms of hierarchy: political, economic, and otherwise; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

These visions have created a very polemical debate around the names of various types of anarchism and related ideas.  For example, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist.  In the United States, &quot;libertarianism&quot; typically does not refer to either anarchism or socialism, while in e.g. Latin America it refers to both.  Finally, the term &quot;anarchy&quot; is frequently used as a perjorative in reference to [[anomie]].

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;.  The unadorned word 'anarchist' popularly denotes this brand of anarchist.

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes escalated into near-insurrections.  In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[regicide]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent.  In fact there is no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence among libertarian socialists.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among many anarchists; others believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified in reaction to what they see as oppression.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.


Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches rather than collectivism. They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.


On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.

Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists view each other's ideas with hostility. Proponents of each of these two theories tend to claim that theirs is the only true anarchism, while the other position is not anarchism at all, because it opposes a wrong notion of power ('archos'). On the other hand, libertarian socialists consider themselves as part of the collectivist movement, while anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as classical liberals - this shows that the opposition between collectivism and individualism in matters of political economy is indeed more essential than the question of the existence of government.

Many libertarian socialists argue that anarcho-capitalism should not be called anarchism at all, due to the much older use of the word to refer to libertarian socialism. Anarcho-capitalists argue they have just as much right to the word as libertarian socialists have, and that their anti-statist tradition is actually older and more coherent. Individualist anarchists could arguably claim &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; are the oldest anarchist tradition, but they care little for such macho &quot;length contests&quot; about the age of traditions, since they don't feel like they are part of a collective they must defend.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[political]] theories which advocate the abolition of all forms of [[government]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean an abolition of all forms of hierarchy: political, economic, and otherwise; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

In different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist.  In the United States, &quot;libertarianism&quot; typically does not refer to either anarchism or socialism, while in e.g. Latin America it refers to both.  Finally, the term &quot;anarchy&quot; is frequently used as a perjorative in reference to [[anomie]].

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;.  The unadorned word 'anarchist' popularly denotes this brand of anarchist.

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes escalated into near-insurrections.  In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[regicide]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent.  In fact there is no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence among libertarian socialists.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among many anarchists; others believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified in reaction to what they see as oppression.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collective-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condened by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; some believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution.

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collective-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condened by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; some believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution.
 
Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

=== Most Famous Anarchists ===

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condened by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condened by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

''How about someone else than me ;) put in their favorite list of healthy, functioning anarchies here?''

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condened by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condened by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike|General_Strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condened by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA.

==Anarchist musicians==

In the past few decades, anarchism has been associated with the punk rock movement, and has grown because of that association (whatever other effects that has had on the movement and the prejudiced pictures of it). Following is some of the more famous anarchist musicians; that is, musicians who happen to be vocally anarchist.

* [[Crass]] (Anarchist/pacifist 'punk' band)
* [[One Minute Silence (band)]] (metal band)
* [[Manu Chao]] (latin folk singer)

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condened by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.

Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all forms of coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negoiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature}.

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condened by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all forms of coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negoiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature}.

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.



=== A Few Famous Anarchists ===

Here is a small selection of some well known figures in anarchist history and thought. For others, see in various categories.
* [[Michael Bakunin]] (1814 - 1876), well-known early [[libertarian socialism|socialist anarchist]]
* [[Peter Kropotkin]] (1842-1921), credited as first theorist of anarcho-communism (an advance on Bakunin's anarchist-collectivism)
* [[Gustave de Molinari]] (1819 - 1912), first theorist of [[anarcho-capitalism]]
* [[Benjamin Tucker]] (1854 - 1939), great defender of [[individualist anarchism]]

* [[Alan Albon]] ([[Freedom]] anarchist fortnightly)
* [[Murray Bookchin]] (leading [[social ecology]] thinker and writer)

==Anarchist musicians==

In the past few decades, anarchism has been associated with the punk rock movement, and has grown because of that association (whatever other effects that has had on the movement and the prejudiced pictures of it). Following is some of the more famous anarchist musicians; that is, musicians who happen to be vocally anarchist.

* [[Crass]] (Anarchist/pacifist 'punk' band)
* [[The Ex]]
* [[Chumbawamba]]
* [[Anarcho-punk]]
* [[John Cage]]
* [[One Minute Silence (band)|One Minute Silence]] (metal band)

Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all forms of coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negoiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature}.

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all forms of coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negoiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature}.

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. 

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. 

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negoiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature}.

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.



=== A Few Famous Anarchists ===

Here is a small selection of some well known figures in anarchist history and thought. For others, see in various categories.
* [[Michael Bakunin]] (1814 - 1876), well-known early [[libertarian socialism|socialist anarchist]]
* [[Peter Kropotkin]] (1842-1921), credited as first theorist of anarcho-communism (an advance on Bakunin's anarchist-collectivism)

==Anarchist musicians==

In the past few decades, anarchism has been associated with the punk rock movement, and has grown because of that association (whatever other effects that has had on the movement and the prejudiced pictures of it). Following is some of the more famous anarchist musicians; that is, musicians who happen to be vocally anarchist.

* [[Crass]] (Anarchist/pacifist 'punk' band)
* [[The Ex]]
* [[Chumbawamba]]
* [[Anarcho-punk]]
* [[John Cage]]

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. 

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

===Anarchism in history===

==Spanish Civil War==

After [[Franco|Franco's]] insurrection in [[July 1936]], a spontaneous social revolution occured in which the [[CNT]], a broadly anarchist union, took control of various &quot;key industries&quot; in [[Catalonia]] especially (as [[George Orwell]] tells us in his [[Homage to Catalonia|personal account of the war]]).

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. 

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.



=== A Few Famous Anarchists ===

Here is a small selection of some well known figures in anarchist history and thought. For others, see in various categories.
* [[Michael Bakunin]] (1814 - 1876), well-known early [[libertarian socialism|socialist anarchist]]
* [[Peter Kropotkin]] (1842-1921), credited as first theorist of anarcho-communism (an advance on Bakunin's anarchist-collectivism)

==Anarchist musicians==

In the past few decades, anarchism has been associated with the punk rock movement, and has grown because of that association (whatever other effects that has had on the movement and the prejudiced pictures of it). Following is some of the more famous anarchist musicians; that is, musicians who happen to be vocally anarchist.

* [[Anarcho-punk]]
* [[John Cage]]
* [[Manu Chao]] (latin folk singer)

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

==Anarchist musicians==

In the past few decades, anarchism has been associated with the punk rock movement, and has grown because of that association (whatever other effects that has had on the movement and the prejudiced pictures of it). Following is some of the more famous anarchist musicians; that is, musicians who happen to be vocally anarchist.

* [[Anarcho-punk]]
* [[John Cage]]
* [[Manu Chao]] (latin folk singer)
* [[Chumbawamba]]
* [[Crass]] (Anarchist/pacifist 'punk' band)
* [[One Minute Silence (band)|One Minute Silence]] (metal band)
* [[The Ex]]

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government]]s replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from the [[state]].  

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. 

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

==Anarchist musicians==

In the past few decades, anarchism has been associated with the punk rock movement, and has grown because of that association (whatever other effects that has had on the movement and the prejudiced pictures of it). Following is some of the more famous anarchist musicians; that is, musicians who happen to be vocally anarchist.

* [[Anarcho-punk]]
* [[John Cage]]
* [[Manu Chao]] (latin folk singer)
* [[Chumbawamba]]
* [[Crass]] (Anarchist/pacifist 'punk' band)
* [[One Minute Silence (band)|One Minute Silence]] (metal band)
* [[The Ex]]

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. 

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance.

The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

==Anarchist musicians==

In the past few decades, anarchism has been associated with the punk rock movement, and has grown because of that association (whatever other effects that has had on the movement and the prejudiced pictures of it). Following is some of the more famous anarchist musicians; that is, musicians who happen to be vocally anarchist.

* [[Anarcho-punk]]
* [[John Cage]]
* [[Manu Chao]] (latin folk singer)
* [[Chumbawamba]]
* [[Crass]] (Anarchist/pacifist 'punk' band)
* [[One Minute Silence (band)|One Minute Silence]] (metal band)
* [[The Ex]]

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. 

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]]. 

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]]. 

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]]. 

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===

However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Anarcho-syndicalist communes]] ===

Prominant during the mid tenth century, anarcho-syndicalist communes functioned by allowing members to take turns acting as a sort of executive office for the week. All deceisions of that officer had to be ratified at a special biweekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs, but by a two-thirds majority in the case of all external affairs. Anarcho-syndicalistic communists believe that supreme executive power derivces from a mandate from the masses, not from ceremonial tradition.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]]. 

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]], and [[pacifism]]. 

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]],[[pacifism]], and [[syndicalism]]. 

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]],[[pacifism]], and [[syndicalism]]. 

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism became appeared alongside [[Revolutionary Socialism]]

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]],[[pacifism]], and [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communists]], [[left-anarchists]], [[anarcho-communists]], [[anarcosocial-communists]], and [[green anarchists]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

=== The theory of Anarchism ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of [[social-communism]], with [[collective ownership]] of [[means of production]] and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any [[government]] [[authority]] or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution.

Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

Anarchism involves the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]],[[pacifism]], and [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communists]], [[left-anarchists]], [[anarcho-communists]], [[anarcosocial-communists]], and [[green anarchists]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no [[rulers]], not no [[rules]].''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

=== The theory of Anarchism ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of [[social-communism]], with [[collective ownership]] of [[means of production]] and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any [[government]] [[authority]] or [[coercion]].

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.

Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

Anarchism involves the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]],[[pacifism]], and [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communism]], [[left-anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarcosocial-communism]], [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], and [[anarcho-feminism]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no [[rulers]], not no [[rules]].''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

=== The theory of Anarchism ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of [[social-communism]], with [[collective ownership]] of [[means of production]] and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any [[government]] [[authority]] or [[coercion]].

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]],[[pacifism]], and [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communism]], [[left-anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarchosocial-communism]], [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[anarcho-feminism]], and [[individualist anarchism]]. There is also [[anarcho-capitalism]] which many anarchists feel is a misuse of the anarcho prefix.

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no [[rulers]], not no [[rules]].''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

=== The theory of Anarchism ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of [[social-communism]], with [[collective ownership]] of [[means of production]] and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any [[government]] [[authority]] or [[coercion]].

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler). Anarchism involves the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, heridatary, etc.) by democratically-controlled and collectively-owned organizations.

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]],[[pacifism]], and [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communism]], [[left-anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarchosocial-communism]], [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[anarcho-feminism]], and [[individualist anarchism]]. There is also [[anarcho-capitalism]] which many anarchists feel is a misuse of the anarcho prefix.

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no [[rulers]], not no [[rules]].''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

=== The theory of Anarchism ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of [[social-communism]], with [[collective ownership]] of [[means of production]] and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any [[government]] [[authority]] or [[coercion]].

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler). Anarchism involves the replacement of all forms of [[hierarchy]] ([[political]], [[economic]], [[hereditary]], etc.) by democratically-controlled and collectively-owned [[organizations]].

Although in some circles anarchism is perceived to be a terrorist philosophy, anarchists dispute this and consider themselves to be [[libertarian socialism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]],[[pacifism]], and [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communism]], [[left-anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarchosocial-communism]], [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[anarcho-feminism]], and [[individualist anarchism]]. There is also [[anarcho-capitalism]] which many anarchists feel is a misuse of the anarcho prefix.

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no [[rulers]], not no [[rules]].''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

=== The theory of Anarchism ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of [[social-communism]], with [[collective ownership]] of [[means of production]] and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any [[government]] [[authority]] or [[coercion]].

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler). Anarchism involves the replacement of all forms of [[hierarchy]] ([[political]], [[economic]], [[hereditary]], etc.) by democratically-controlled and collectively-owned [[organizations]].

Although in some circles anarchism is perceived to be a terrorist philosophy, anarchists dispute this and consider themselves to be practitioners of [[libertarian socialism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]], [[pacifism]], [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communism]], [[left-anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarchosocial-communism]], [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[anarcho-feminism]], and [[individualist anarchism]]. There is also [[anarcho-capitalism]] which many anarchists feel is a misuse of the anarcho prefix.

While it might seem that anarchism implies a total lack of [[law]], most anarchists believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no [[rulers]], not no [[rules]].''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

=== The theory of Anarchism ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of [[social-communism]], with [[collective ownership]] of [[means of production]] and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any [[government]] [[authority]] or [[coercion]].

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

The Anarchist Movement is generally considered allied with the American Indian Movement and the Palestinian Liberation Organization. Anarchism is most popular in North America, Western Europe, and Japan.

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler). Anarchism involves the replacement of all forms of [[hierarchy]] ([[political]], [[economic]], [[hereditary]], etc.) by democratically-controlled and collectively-owned [[organizations]].

Although in some circles anarchism is perceived to be a terrorist philosophy, anarchists dispute this and consider themselves to be practitioners of [[libertarian socialism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]], [[pacifism]], [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communism]], [[left-anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarchosocial-communism]], [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[anarcho-feminism]], [[individualist anarchism]], and [[red anarchism]]. There is also [[anarcho-capitalism]] which many anarchists feel is a misuse of the anarcho prefix.

While it might seem that anarchism implies a total lack of [[law]], most anarchists believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no [[rulers]], not no [[rules]].''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

The Anarchist Movement is generally considered allied with the American Indian Movement and the Palestinian Liberation Organization. Anarchism is most popular in North America, Western Europe, and Japan.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler). Anarchism involves the replacement of all forms of [[hierarchy]] ([[political]], [[economic]], [[hereditary]], etc.) by democratically-controlled and collectively-owned [[organizations]].

Although in some circles anarchism is perceived to be a terrorist philosophy, anarchists dispute this and consider themselves to be practitioners of [[libertarian socialism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]], [[pacifism]], [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communism]], [[left-anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarchosocial-communism]], [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[anarcho-feminism]], [[individualist anarchism]], and [[red anarchism]]. There is also [[anarcho-capitalism]] which many anarchists feel is a misuse of the anarcho prefix.

While it might seem that anarchism implies a total lack of [[law]], most anarchists believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no [[rulers]], not no [[rules]].''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

The [[Anarchist Movement]] is generally considered allied with the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) and the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO. Anarchism is most popular in [[North America]], [[Western Europe]], and [[Japan]]. Within the United States, there are several third parties that have anarchist followings.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

=== The theory of Anarchism ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of [[social-communism]], with [[collective ownership]] of [[means of production]] and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any [[government]] [[authority]] or [[coercion]].

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler). Anarchism involves the replacement of all forms of [[hierarchy]] ([[political]], [[economic]], [[hereditary]], etc.) by democratically-controlled and collectively-owned [[organizations]].

Although in some circles anarchism is perceived to be a terrorist philosophy, anarchists dispute this and consider themselves to be practitioners of [[libertarian socialism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]], [[pacifism]], [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communism]], [[left-anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarchosocial-communism]], [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[anarcho-feminism]], [[individualist anarchism]], and [[red anarchism]]. There is also [[anarcho-capitalism]] which many anarchists feel is a misuse of the anarcho prefix.

While it might seem that anarchism implies a total lack of [[law]], most anarchists believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no [[rulers]], not no [[rules]].''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

The [[Anarchist Movement]] is generally considered to be allied with the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM), the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO), and the [[Black Panthers]]. Anarchism is most popular in [[North America]], [[Western Europe]], and [[Japan]]. Within the United States, there are several third parties that have anarchist followings.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

=== The theory of Anarchism ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of [[social-communism]], with [[collective ownership]] of [[means of production]] and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any [[government]] [[authority]] or [[coercion]].

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Anarchism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]]. 

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  

=== [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] ===

[[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. The philosophy was popular amongst radical labor unions in the early twentieth century, notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories (the &quot;means of production&quot;).

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler). Anarchism involves the replacement of all forms of [[hierarchy]] ([[political]], [[economic]], [[hereditary]], etc.) by democratically-controlled and collectively-owned [[organizations]].

Although in some circles anarchism is perceived to be a terrorist philosophy, anarchists dispute this and consider themselves to be practitioners of [[libertarian socialism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]], [[pacifism]], [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communism]], [[left-anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarchosocial-communism]], [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[anarcho-feminism]], [[individualist anarchism]], and [[red anarchism]]. There is also [[anarcho-capitalism]] which many anarchists feel is a misuse of the anarcho prefix.

While it might seem that anarchism implies a total lack of [[law]], most anarchists believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.

The [[Anarchist Movement]] is generally considered to be allied with the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM), the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO), and the [[Black Panthers]]. Anarchism is most popular in [[North America]], [[Western Europe]], and [[Japan]]. Within the United States, there are several third parties that have anarchist followings.

Anarchism is most popular in [[North America]], [[Western Europe]], and [[Japan]]. Within the United States, there are several third parties that have anarchist followings.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

=== The theory of Anarchism ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of [[social-communism]], with [[collective ownership]] of [[means of production]] and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any [[government]] [[authority]] or [[coercion]].

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Many anarchists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  Anarchists see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler). Anarchism involves the replacement of all forms of [[hierarchy]] ([[political]], [[economic]], [[hereditary]], etc.) by democratically-controlled and collectively-owned [[organizations]].

Although in some circles anarchism is perceived to be a terrorist philosophy, anarchists dispute this and consider themselves to be practitioners of [[libertarian socialism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]], [[pacifism]], [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communism]], [[left-anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarchosocial-communism]], [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[anarcho-feminism]], [[individualist anarchism]], and [[red anarchism]]. There is also [[anarcho-capitalism]] which many anarchists feel is a misuse of the anarcho prefix.

While it might seem that anarchism implies a total lack of [[law]], most anarchists believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no [[rulers]], not no [[rules]].''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

The [[Anarchist Movement]] is generally considered to be allied with the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM), the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO), and the [[Black Panthers]].

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]]. 

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  

=== [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] ===

[[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. The philosophy was popular amongst radical labor unions in the early twentieth century, notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories (the &quot;means of production&quot;).

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]]. 

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  

=== [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] ===

[[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. The philosophy was popular amongst radical labor unions in the early twentieth century, notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories (the &quot;means of production&quot;).

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

[[eo:Anarkismo]][[fr:Anarchisme]][[pl:Anarchizm]]
'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler). Anarchism involves the replacement of all forms of [[hierarchy]] ([[political]], [[economic]], [[hereditary]], etc.) by democratically-controlled and collectively-owned [[organizations]].

Although in some circles anarchism is perceived to be a terrorist philosophy, anarchists dispute this and consider themselves to be practitioners of [[libertarian socialism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]], [[pacifism]], [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communism]], [[left-anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarchosocial-communism]], [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[anarcho-feminism]], [[individualist anarchism]], and [[red anarchism]]. There is also [[anarcho-capitalism]] which many anarchists feel is a misuse of the anarcho prefix.

While it might seem that anarchism implies a total lack of [[law]], most anarchists believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no [[rulers]], not no [[rules]].''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

The [[Anarchist Movement]] is generally considered to be allied with the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM), the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO), and the [[Black Panthers]]. Anarchism is most popular in [[North America]], [[Western Europe]], and [[Japan]]. Within the United States, there are several third parties that have anarchist followings.

However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

=== The theory of Anarchism ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of [[social-communism]], with [[collective ownership]] of [[means of production]] and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any [[government]] [[authority]] or [[coercion]].

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

[[eo:Anarkismo]][[fr:Anarchisme]][[pl:Anarchizm]]
'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler). Anarchism involves the replacement of all forms of [[hierarchy]] ([[political]], [[economic]], [[hereditary]], etc.) by democratically-controlled and collectively-owned [[organizations]].

Although in some circles anarchism is perceived to be a terrorist philosophy, anarchists dispute this and consider themselves to be practitioners of [[libertarian socialism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]], [[pacifism]], [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communism]], [[left-anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarchosocial-communism]], [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[anarcho-feminism]], [[individualist anarchism]], and [[red anarchism]]. There is also [[anarcho-capitalism]] which many anarchists feel is a misuse of the anarcho prefix.

While it might seem that anarchism implies a total lack of [[law]], most anarchists believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no [[rulers]], not no [[rules]].''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

The [[Anarchist Movement]] is generally considered to be allied with the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM), the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO), and the [[Black Panthers]]. Anarchism is most popular in [[North America]], [[Western Europe]], and [[Japan]]. Within the United States, there are several third parties that have anarchist followings.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

=== The theory of Anarchism ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of [[social-communism]], with [[collective ownership]] of [[means of production]] and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any [[government]] [[authority]] or [[coercion]].

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Many anarchists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  Anarchists see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Anarchism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].

[[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  

=== [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] ===

[[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. The philosophy was popular amongst radical labor unions in the early twentieth century, notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories (the &quot;means of production&quot;).

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Anarchism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  

=== [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] ===

[[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. The philosophy was popular amongst radical labor unions in the early twentieth century, notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories (the &quot;means of production&quot;).

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

[[eo:Anarkismo]][[fr:Anarchisme]][[pl:Anarchizm]]
'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler). Anarchism involves the replacement of all forms of [[hierarchy]] ([[political]], [[economic]], [[hereditary]], etc.) by democratically-controlled and collectively-owned [[organizations]].

Although in some circles anarchism is perceived to be a terrorist philosophy, anarchists dispute this and consider themselves to be practitioners of [[libertarian socialism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]], [[pacifism]], [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communism]], [[left-anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarchosocial-communism]], [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[anarcho-feminism]], [[individualist anarchism]], andor [[red anarchism]]. There is also [[anarcho-capitalism]] which many anarchists feel is a misuse of the anarcho prefix.

While it might seem that anarchism implies a total lack of [[law]], most anarchists believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no [[rulers]], not no [[rules]].''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

The [[Anarchist Movement]] is generally considered to be allied with the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM), the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO), the [[Black Panthers]], and the [[Zapatistas]]. Anarchism is most popular in [[North America]], [[Western Europe]], and [[Japan]]. Within the United States, there are several third parties that have anarchist followings.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

=== The theory of Anarchism ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of [[social-communism]], with [[collective ownership]] of [[means of production]] and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any [[government]] [[authority]] or [[coercion]].

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Many anarchists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  Anarchists see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]].

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

[[eo:Anarkismo]][[fr:Anarchisme]][[pl:Anarchizm]]
'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler). Anarchism involves the replacement of all forms of [[hierarchy]] ([[political]], [[economic]], [[hereditary]], etc.) by democratically-controlled and collectively-owned [[organizations]].

Although in some circles anarchism is perceived to be a terrorist philosophy, anarchists dispute this and consider themselves to be practitioners of [[libertarian socialism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]], [[pacifism]], [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communism]], [[left-anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarchosocial-communism]], [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[anarcho-feminism]], [[individualist anarchism]], andor [[red anarchism]]. There is also [[anarcho-capitalism]] which many anarchists feel is a misuse of the anarcho prefix.

While it might seem that anarchism implies a total lack of [[law]], most anarchists believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no [[rulers]], not no [[rules]].''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

The [[Anarchist Movement]] is generally considered to be allied with the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM), the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO), the [[Black Panthers]], and the [[Zapatistas]]. Anarchism is most popular in [[North America]], [[Western Europe]], and [[Japan]]. Within the United States, there are several third parties that have anarchist followings.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

=== The theory of Anarchism ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of [[social-communism]], with [[collective ownership]] of [[means of production]] and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any [[government]] [[authority]] or [[coercion]].

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Many anarchists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  Anarchists see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;. Opponents of this theory call adherents, &quot;super-capitalists&quot;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  

=== [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] ===

[[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. The philosophy was popular amongst radical labor unions in the early twentieth century, notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories (the &quot;means of production&quot;).

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Anarchism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  

=== [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] ===

[[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. The philosophy was popular amongst radical labor unions in the early twentieth century, notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories (the &quot;means of production&quot;).

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler). Anarchism involves the replacement of all forms of [[hierarchy]] ([[political]], [[economic]], [[hereditary]], etc.) by democratically-controlled and collectively-owned [[organizations]].

Although in some circles anarchism is perceived to be a terrorist philosophy, anarchists dispute this and consider themselves to be practitioners of [[libertarian socialism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]], [[pacifism]], [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communism]], [[left-anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarchosocial-communism]], [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[anarcho-feminism]], [[individualist anarchism]], andor [[red anarchism]]. There is also [[anarcho-capitalism]] which many anarchists feel is a misuse of the anarcho prefix.

While it might seem that anarchism implies a total lack of [[law]], most anarchists believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no [[rulers]], not no [[rules]].''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

The [[Anarchist Movement]] is generally considered to be allied with the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM), the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO), the [[Black Panthers]], and the [[Zapatistas]]. Anarchism is most popular in [[North America]], [[Western Europe]], and [[Japan]]. Within the United States, there are several third parties that have anarchist followings.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

=== The theory of Anarchism ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of [[social-communism]], with [[collective ownership]] of [[means of production]] and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any [[government]] [[authority]] or [[coercion]].

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Many anarchists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

[[eo:Anarkismo]][[fr:Anarchisme]][[pl:Anarchizm]]
'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler). Anarchism involves the replacement of all forms of [[hierarchy]] ([[political]], [[economic]], [[hereditary]], etc.) by democratically-controlled and collectively-owned [[organizations]].

Although in some circles anarchism is perceived to be a terrorist philosophy, anarchists dispute this and consider themselves to be practitioners of [[libertarian socialism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]], [[pacifism]], [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communism]], [[left-anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarchosocial-communism]], [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[anarcho-feminism]], [[individualist anarchism]], andor [[red anarchism]]. There is also [[anarcho-capitalism]] which many anarchists feel is a misuse of the anarcho prefix.

While it might seem that anarchism implies a total lack of [[law]], most anarchists believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no [[rulers]], not no [[rules]].''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

The [[Anarchist Movement]] is generally considered to be allied with the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM), the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO), the [[Black Panthers]], and the [[Zapatistas]]. Anarchism is most popular in [[North America]], [[Western Europe]], and [[Japan]]. Within the United States, there are several third parties that have anarchist followings.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

=== The theory of Anarchism ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of [[social-communism]], with [[collective ownership]] of [[means of production]] and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any [[government]] [[authority]] or [[coercion]].

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Many anarchists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  Anarchists see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;. Opponents of this theory call adherents, &quot;super-capitalists&quot;. It is worth noting that anarchists are generally opposed to [[capitalism]], arguing that it inherently leads to totalitarianism...thus the belief that [[anarcho-capitalism]] is an [[oxymoron]]. Anarcho-capitalists tend to disagree strongy with anarchists as well, and the two viewpoints are strongly in opposition.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  

=== [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] ===

[[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. The philosophy was popular amongst radical labor unions in the early twentieth century, notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories (the &quot;means of production&quot;).

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

=== The theory of Anarchism ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of [[social-communism]], with [[collective ownership]] of [[means of production]] and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any [[government]] [[authority]] or [[coercion]].

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Many anarchists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  Anarchists see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;. Opponents of this theory call adherents, &quot;super-capitalists&quot;. It is worth noting that anarchists are generally opposed to [[capitalism]], arguing that it inherently leads to totalitarianism...thus the belief that [[anarcho-capitalism]] is an [[oxymoron]]. Anarcho-capitalists tend to disagree strongy with anarchists as well, and the two viewpoints are strongly in opposition.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists support the American Revolution for totally different reason than Anarchists. Anarchists tend to argue that the American Revolution was betrayed much like the Russian Revolution. They argue that the capitalists fought the war, not for freedom of people, but for freedom of corporations. They note that a major incentive for individuals such as George Washington to revolt from England was that England was ordered to halt the genocide against Native Americans.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Anarchism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  

=== [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] ===

[[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. The philosophy was popular amongst radical labor unions in the early twentieth century, notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories (the &quot;means of production&quot;).

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

[[eo:Anarkismo]][[fr:Anarchisme]][[pl:Anarchizm]]
'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler). Anarchism involves the replacement of all forms of [[hierarchy]] ([[political]], [[economic]], [[hereditary]], etc.) by democratically-controlled and collectively-owned [[organizations]].

Although in some circles anarchism is perceived to be a terrorist philosophy, anarchists dispute this and consider themselves to be practitioners of [[libertarian socialism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]], [[pacifism]], [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communism]], [[left-anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarchosocial-communism]], [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[anarcho-feminism]], [[individualist anarchism]], andor [[red anarchism]]. There is also [[anarcho-capitalism]] which many anarchists feel is a misuse of the anarcho prefix.

While it might seem that anarchism implies a total lack of [[law]], most anarchists believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no [[rulers]], not no [[rules]].''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

The [[Anarchist Movement]] is generally considered to be allied with the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM), the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO), the [[Black Panthers]], and the [[Zapatistas]]. Anarchism is most popular in [[North America]], [[Western Europe]], and [[Japan]]. Within the United States, there are several third parties that have anarchist followings.

This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  

=== [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] ===

[[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. The philosophy was popular amongst radical labor unions in the early twentieth century, notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories (the &quot;means of production&quot;).

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

[[eo:Anarkismo]][[fr:Anarchisme]][[pl:Anarchizm]]
'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler). Anarchism involves the replacement of all forms of [[hierarchy]] ([[political]], [[economic]], [[hereditary]], etc.) by democratically-controlled and collectively-owned [[organizations]].

Although in some circles anarchism is perceived to be a terrorist philosophy, anarchists dispute this and consider themselves to be practitioners of [[libertarian socialism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]], [[pacifism]], [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communism]], [[left-anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarchosocial-communism]], [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[anarcho-feminism]], [[individualist anarchism]], andor [[red anarchism]]. There is also [[anarcho-capitalism]] which many anarchists feel is a misuse of the anarcho prefix.

While it might seem that anarchism implies a total lack of [[law]], most anarchists believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no [[rulers]], not no [[rules]].''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

The [[Anarchist Movement]] is generally considered to be allied with the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM), the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO), the [[Black Panthers]], and the [[Zapatistas]]. Anarchism is most popular in [[North America]], [[Western Europe]], and [[Japan]]. Within the United States, there are several third parties that have anarchist followings.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

=== The theory of Anarchism ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of [[social-communism]], with [[collective ownership]] of [[means of production]] and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any [[government]] [[authority]] or [[coercion]].

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Many anarchists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  Anarchists see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;. Opponents of this theory call adherents, &quot;super-capitalists&quot;. It is worth noting that anarchists are generally opposed to [[capitalism]], arguing that it inherently leads to totalitarianism...thus the belief that [[anarcho-capitalism]] is an [[oxymoron]]. Anarcho-capitalists tend to disagree strongy with anarchists as well, and the two viewpoints are strongly in opposition.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists support the [[American Revolution]] for totally different reason than Anarchists. Anarchists tend to argue that the American Revolution was betrayed much like the [[Russian Revolution]]. They argue that the capitalists fought the war, not for freedom of people, but for freedom of corporations. They note that a major incentive for individuals such as [[George Washington]] to revolt from [[England]] was that England was ordering the capitalists to halt the [[genocide]] against [[Native Americans]].

This split in thinking between the forces of the American Revolution led to the rise of the American [[Democratic Party]], [[Democratic-Republican Party]], [[Whig Party]], [[National Republican Party]], [[Old Republican Party]], [[Federalist Party]], and, of course, the [[Worker's Party]], [[Green Party]], [[Anti-Mason Party]], and [[Socialist Party]]. 

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''.

[[eo:Anarkismo]][[fr:Anarchisme]][[pl:Anarchizm]]
'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler). Anarchism involves the replacement of all forms of [[hierarchy]] ([[political]], [[economic]], [[hereditary]], etc.) by democratically-controlled and collectively-owned [[organizations]].

Although in some circles anarchism is perceived to be a terrorist philosophy, anarchists dispute this and consider themselves to be practitioners of[[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]], [[pacifism]], [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communism]], [[left-anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarchosocial-communism]], [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[anarcho-feminism]], [[individualist anarchism]], andor [[red anarchism]]. There is also [[anarcho-capitalism]] which many anarchists feel is a misuse of the anarcho prefix.

While it might seem that anarchism implies a total lack of [[law]], most anarchists believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no [[rulers]], not no [[rules]].''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

The [[Anarchist Movement]] is generally considered to be allied with the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM), the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO), the [[Black Panthers]], and the [[Zapatistas]]. Anarchism is most popular in [[North America]], [[Western Europe]], and [[Japan]]. Within the United States, there are several third parties that have anarchist followings.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

=== The theory of Anarchism ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of [[social-communism]], with [[collective ownership]] of [[means of production]] and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any [[government]] [[authority]] or [[coercion]].

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Many anarchists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  Anarchists see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;. Opponents of this theory call adherents, &quot;super-capitalists&quot;. It is worth noting that anarchists are generally opposed to [[capitalism]], arguing that it inherently leads to totalitarianism...thus the belief that [[anarcho-capitalism]] is an [[oxymoron]]. Anarcho-capitalists tend to disagree strongy with anarchists as well, and the two viewpoints are strongly in opposition.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists support the [[American Revolution]] for totally different reason than Anarchists. Anarchists tend to argue that the American Revolution was betrayed much like the [[Russian Revolution]]. They argue that the capitalists fought the war, not for freedom of people, but for freedom of corporations. They note that a major incentive for individuals such as [[George Washington]] to revolt from [[England]] was that England was ordering the capitalists to halt the [[genocide]] against [[Native Americans]].

This split in thinking between the forces of the American Revolution led to the rise of the American [[Democratic Party]], [[Democratic-Republican Party]], [[Whig Party]], [[National Republican Party]], [[Old Republican Party]], [[Federalist Party]], and, of course, the [[Worker's Party]], [[Green Party]], [[Anti-Mason Party]], and [[Socialist Party]]. 

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Anarchism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  

=== [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] ===

[[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. The philosophy was popular amongst radical labor unions in the early twentieth century, notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories (the &quot;means of production&quot;).

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  

=== [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] ===

[[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. The philosophy was popular amongst radical labor unions in the early twentieth century, notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories (the &quot;means of production&quot;).

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]].

[[eo:Anarkismo]][[fr:Anarchisme]][[pl:Anarchizm]]
'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler). Anarchism involves the replacement of all forms of [[hierarchy]] ([[political]], [[economic]], [[hereditary]], etc.) by democratically-controlled and collectively-owned [[organizations]].

Although in some circles anarchism is perceived to be a terrorist philosophy, anarchists dispute this and consider themselves to be practitioners of[[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]], [[pacifism]], [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communism]], [[left-anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarchosocial-communism]], [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[anarcho-feminism]], [[individualist anarchism]], andor [[red anarchism]]. There is also [[anarcho-capitalism]] which many anarchists feel is a misuse of the anarcho prefix.

While it might seem that anarchism implies a total lack of [[law]], most anarchists believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no [[rulers]], not no [[rules]].''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

The [[Anarchist Movement]] is generally considered to be allied with the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM), the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO), the [[Black Panthers]], and the [[Zapatistas]]. Anarchism is most popular in [[North America]], [[Western Europe]], and [[Japan]]. Within the United States, there are several third parties that have anarchist followings.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

=== The theory of Anarchism ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of [[social-communism]], with [[collective ownership]] of [[means of production]] and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any [[government]] [[authority]] or [[coercion]].

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Many anarchists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  Anarchists see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;. Opponents of this theory call adherents, &quot;super-capitalists&quot;. It is worth noting that anarchists are generally opposed to [[capitalism]], arguing that it inherently leads to totalitarianism...thus the belief that [[anarcho-capitalism]] is an [[oxymoron]]. Anarcho-capitalists tend to disagree strongy with anarchists as well, and the two viewpoints are strongly in opposition.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists support the [[American Revolution]] for totally different reason than Anarchists. Anarchists tend to argue that the American Revolution was betrayed much like the [[Russian Revolution]]. They argue that the capitalists fought the war, not for freedom of people, but for freedom of corporations. They note that a major incentive for individuals such as [[George Washington]] to revolt from [[England]] was that England was ordering the capitalists to halt the [[genocide]] against [[Native Americans]].

This split in thinking between the forces of the American Revolution led to the rise of the American [[Democratic Party]], [[Democratic-Republican Party]], [[Whig Party]], [[National Republican Party]], [[Old Republican Party]], [[Federalist Party]], and, of course, the [[Worker's Party]], [[Green Party]], [[Anti-Mason Party]], and [[Socialist Party]]. 

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

[[eo:Anarkismo]][[fr:Anarchisme]][[pl:Anarchizm]]
'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler). Anarchism involves the replacement of all forms of [[hierarchy]] ([[political]], [[economic]], [[hereditary]], etc.) by democratically-controlled and collectively-owned [[organizations]].

Although in some circles anarchism is perceived to be a terrorist philosophy, anarchists dispute this and consider themselves to be practitioners of[[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]], [[pacifism]], [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communism]], [[left-anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarchosocial-communism]], [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[anarcho-feminism]], [[individualist anarchism]], andor [[red anarchism]]. There is also [[anarcho-capitalism]] which many anarchists feel is a misuse of the anarcho prefix.

While it might seem that anarchism implies a total lack of [[law]], most anarchists believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no [[rulers]], not no [[rules]].''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

The [[Anarchist Movement]] is generally considered to be allied with the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM), the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO), the [[Black Panthers]], and the [[Zapatistas]]. Anarchism is most popular in [[North America]], [[Western Europe]], and [[Japan]]. Within the United States, there are several third parties that have anarchist followings.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

=== The theory of Anarchism ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of [[social-communism]], with [[collective ownership]] of [[means of production]] and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any [[government]] [[authority]] or [[coercion]].

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Many anarchists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  Anarchists see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;. Opponents of this theory call adherents, &quot;super-capitalists&quot;. It is worth noting that anarchists are generally opposed to [[capitalism]], arguing that it inherently leads to totalitarianism...thus the belief that [[anarcho-capitalism]] is an [[oxymoron]]. Anarcho-capitalists tend to disagree strongy with anarchists as well, and the two viewpoints are strongly in opposition.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists support the [[American Revolution]] for totally different reason than Anarchists. Anarchists tend to argue that the American Revolution was betrayed much like the [[Russian Revolution]]. They argue that the capitalists fought the war, not for freedom of people, but for freedom of corporations. They note that a major incentive for individuals such as [[George Washington]] to revolt from [[England]] was that England was ordering the capitalists to halt the [[genocide]] against [[Native Americans]].

This split in thinking between the forces of the American Revolution led to the rise of the American [[Democratic Party]], [[Democratic-Republican Party]], [[Whig Party]], [[National Republican Party]], [[Old Republican Party]], [[Federalist Party]], and, of course, the [[Worker's Party]], [[Green Party]], [[Anti-Mason Party]], and [[Socialist Party]]. 

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Anarchists loathe capitalism.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected. In short, this is an emphasis on democracy.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Anarchism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  

=== [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] ===

[[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. The philosophy was popular amongst radical labor unions in the early twentieth century, notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories (the &quot;means of production&quot;).

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

The incorrect idea that political anarchy equates to absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by [[Durkheim]]'s sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that the government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without the nation-states.  

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Anarchism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  

=== [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] ===

[[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. The philosophy was popular amongst radical labor unions in the early twentieth century, notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories (the &quot;means of production&quot;).

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]]. 

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]].

[[eo:Anarkismo]][[fr:Anarchisme]][[pl:Anarchizm]]
'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler). Anarchism involves the replacement of all forms of [[hierarchy]] ([[political]], [[economic]], [[hereditary]], etc.) by democratically-controlled and collectively-owned [[organizations]].

Although in some circles anarchism is perceived to be a terrorist philosophy, anarchists dispute this and consider themselves to be practitioners of[[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]], [[pacifism]], [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communism]], [[left-anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarchosocial-communism]], [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[anarcho-feminism]], [[individualist anarchism]], andor [[red anarchism]]. There is also [[anarcho-capitalism]] which many anarchists feel is a misuse of the anarcho prefix.

While it might seem that anarchism implies a total lack of [[law]], most anarchists believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no [[rulers]], not no [[rules]].''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

The [[Anarchist Movement]] is generally considered to be allied with the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM), the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO), the [[Black Panthers]], and the [[Zapatistas]]. Anarchism is most popular in [[North America]], [[Western Europe]], and [[Japan]]. Within the United States, there are several third parties that have anarchist followings.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

=== The theory of Anarchism ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of [[social-communism]], with [[collective ownership]] of [[means of production]] and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any [[government]] [[authority]] or [[coercion]].

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Many anarchists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  Anarchists see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;. Opponents of this theory call adherents, &quot;super-capitalists&quot;. It is worth noting that anarchists are generally opposed to [[capitalism]], arguing that it inherently leads to totalitarianism...thus the belief that [[anarcho-capitalism]] is an [[oxymoron]]. Anarcho-capitalists tend to disagree strongy with anarchists as well, and the two viewpoints are strongly in opposition.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists support the [[American Revolution]] for totally different reason than Anarchists. Anarchists tend to argue that the American Revolution was betrayed much like the [[Russian Revolution]]. They argue that the capitalists fought the war, not for freedom of people, but for freedom of corporations. They note that a major incentive for individuals such as [[George Washington]] to revolt from [[England]] was that England was ordering the capitalists to halt the [[genocide]] against [[Native Americans]].

This split in thinking between the forces of the American Revolution led to the rise of the American [[Democratic Party]], [[Democratic-Republican Party]], [[Whig Party]], [[National Republican Party]], [[Old Republican Party]], [[Federalist Party]], and, of course, the [[Worker's Party]], [[Green Party]], [[Anti-Mason Party]], and [[Socialist Party]]. 

Anarchists loathe capitalism.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected. In short, this is an emphasis on democracy.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The incorrect idea that political anarchy equates to absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by [[Durkheim]]'s sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that the government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without the nation-states.  

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Anarchism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  

=== [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] ===

[[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. The philosophy was popular amongst radical labor unions in the early twentieth century, notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories (the &quot;means of production&quot;).

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===

[[eo:Anarkismo]][[fr:Anarchisme]][[pl:Anarchizm]]
'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler). Anarchism involves the replacement of all forms of [[hierarchy]] ([[political]], [[economic]], [[hereditary]], etc.) by democratically-controlled and collectively-owned [[organizations]].

Although in some circles anarchism is perceived to be a terrorist philosophy, anarchists dispute this and consider themselves to be practitioners of[[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]], [[pacifism]], [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communism]], [[left-anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarchosocial-communism]], [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[anarcho-feminism]], [[individualist anarchism]], andor [[red anarchism]]. There is also [[anarcho-capitalism]] which many anarchists feel is a misuse of the anarcho prefix.

While it might seem that anarchism implies a total lack of [[law]], most anarchists believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no [[rulers]], not no [[rules]].''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

The [[Anarchist Movement]] is generally considered to be allied with the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM), the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO), the [[Black Panthers]], and the [[Zapatistas]]. Anarchism is most popular in [[North America]], [[Western Europe]], and [[Japan]]. Within the United States, there are several third parties that have anarchist followings.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

=== The theory of Anarchism ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of [[social-communism]], with [[collective ownership]] of [[means of production]] and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any [[government]] [[authority]] or [[coercion]].

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Many anarchists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  Anarchists see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;. Opponents of this theory call adherents, &quot;super-capitalists&quot;. It is worth noting that anarchists are generally opposed to [[capitalism]], arguing that it inherently leads to totalitarianism...thus the belief that [[anarcho-capitalism]] is an [[oxymoron]]. Anarcho-capitalists tend to disagree strongly with anarchists as well, and the two viewpoints are strongly in opposition.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarchists tend to argue that the American Revolution was betrayed much like the [[Russian Revolution]]. They argue that the capitalists fought the war, not for freedom of people, but for freedom of corporations. They note that a major incentive for individuals such as [[George Washington]] to revolt from [[England]] was that England was ordering the capitalists to halt the [[genocide]] against [[Native Americans]].

However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]]. 

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

[[eo:Anarkismo]][[fr:Anarchisme]][[pl:Anarchizm]]
'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler). Anarchism involves the replacement of all forms of [[hierarchy]] ([[political]], [[economic]], [[hereditary]], etc.) by democratically-controlled and collectively-owned [[organizations]].

Although in some circles anarchism is perceived to be a terrorist philosophy, anarchists dispute this and consider themselves to be practitioners of[[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]], [[pacifism]], [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communism]], [[left-anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarchosocial-communism]], [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[anarcho-feminism]], [[individualist anarchism]], andor [[red anarchism]]. There is also [[anarcho-capitalism]] which many anarchists feel is a misuse of the anarcho prefix.

While it might seem that anarchism implies a total lack of [[law]], most anarchists believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no [[rulers]], not no [[rules]].''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

The [[Anarchist Movement]] is generally considered to be allied with the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM), the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO), the [[Black Panthers]], and the [[Zapatistas]]. Anarchism is most popular in [[North America]], [[Western Europe]], and [[Japan]]. Within the United States, there are several third parties that have anarchist followings.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

=== The theory of Anarchism ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of [[social-communism]], with [[collective ownership]] of [[means of production]] and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any [[government]] [[authority]] or [[coercion]].

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Many anarchists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  Anarchists see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;. Opponents of this theory call adherents, &quot;super-capitalists&quot;. It is worth noting that anarchists are generally opposed to [[capitalism]], arguing that it inherently leads to totalitarianism...thus the belief that [[anarcho-capitalism]] is an [[oxymoron]]. Anarcho-capitalists tend to disagree strongly with anarchists as well, and the two viewpoints are strongly in opposition.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists support the [[American Revolution]] for totally different reason than Anarchists. Anarchists tend to argue that the American Revolution was betrayed much like the [[Russian Revolution]]. They argue that the capitalists fought the war, not for freedom of people, but for freedom of corporations. They note that a major incentive for individuals such as [[George Washington]] to revolt from [[England]] was that England was ordering the capitalists to halt the [[genocide]] against [[Native Americans]].

This split in thinking between the forces of the American Revolution led to the rise of the American [[Democratic Party]], [[Democratic-Republican Party]], [[Whig Party]], [[National Republican Party]], [[Old Republican Party]], [[Federalist Party]], and, of course, the [[Worker's Party]], [[Green Party]], [[Anti-Mason Party]], and [[Socialist Party]]. 

Anarchists loathe capitalism.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected. In short, this is an emphasis on democracy.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The incorrect idea that political anarchy equates to absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by [[Durkheim]]'s sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that the government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without the nation-states.  

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Anarchism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance.

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution.

Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  

=== [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] ===

[[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. The philosophy was popular amongst radical labor unions in the early twentieth century, notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories (the &quot;means of production&quot;).

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]]. 

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]]. 

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

[[eo:Anarkismo]][[fr:Anarchisme]][[pl:Anarchizm]]
'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler). Anarchism involves the replacement of all forms of [[hierarchy]] ([[political]], [[economic]], [[hereditary]], etc.) by democratically-controlled and collectively-owned [[organizations]].

Although in some circles anarchism is perceived to be a terrorist philosophy, anarchists dispute this and consider themselves to be practitioners of[[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]], [[pacifism]], [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communism]], [[left-anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarchosocial-communism]], [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[anarcho-feminism]], [[individualist anarchism]], andor [[red anarchism]]. There is also [[anarcho-capitalism]] which many anarchists feel is a misuse of the anarcho prefix.

While it might seem that anarchism implies a total lack of [[law]], most anarchists believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no [[rulers]], not no [[rules]].''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

The [[Anarchist Movement]] is generally considered to be allied with the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM), the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO), the [[Black Panthers]], and the [[Zapatistas]]. Anarchism is most popular in [[North America]], [[Western Europe]], and [[Japan]]. Within the United States, there are several third parties that have anarchist followings.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

=== The theory of Anarchism ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of [[social-communism]], with [[collective ownership]] of [[means of production]] and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any [[government]] [[authority]] or [[coercion]].

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Many anarchists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  Anarchists see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;. Opponents of this theory call adherents, &quot;super-capitalists&quot;. It is worth noting that anarchists are generally opposed to [[capitalism]], arguing that it inherently leads to totalitarianism...thus the belief that [[anarcho-capitalism]] is an [[oxymoron]]. Anarcho-capitalists tend to disagree strongly with anarchists as well, and the two viewpoints are strongly in opposition.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists support the [[American Revolution]] for totally different reason than Anarchists. Anarchists tend to argue that the American Revolution was betrayed much like the [[Russian Revolution]]. They argue that the capitalists fought the war, not for freedom of people, but for freedom of corporations. They note that a major incentive for individuals such as [[George Washington]] to revolt from [[England]] was that England was ordering the capitalists to halt the [[genocide]] against [[Native Americans]].

This split in thinking between the forces of the American Revolution led to the rise of the American [[Democratic Party]], [[Democratic-Republican Party]], [[Whig Party]], [[National Republican Party]], [[Old Republican Party]], [[Federalist Party]], and, of course, the [[Worker's Party]], [[Green Party]], [[Anti-Mason Party]], and [[Socialist Party]]. 

Anarchists loathe capitalism.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

In short, this is an emphasis on democracy.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The incorrect idea that political anarchy equates to absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by [[Durkheim]]'s sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that the government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without the nation-states.  

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Anarchism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

[[eo:Anarkismo]][[fr:Anarchisme]][[pl:Anarchizm]]
'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler). Anarchism involves the replacement of all forms of [[hierarchy]] ([[political]], [[economic]], [[hereditary]], etc.) by democratically-controlled and collectively-owned [[organizations]].

Although in some circles anarchism is perceived to be a terrorist philosophy, anarchists dispute this and consider themselves to be practitioners of[[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]], [[pacifism]], [[syndicalism]], [[libertarian communism]], [[left-anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[anarchosocial-communism]], [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[anarcho-feminism]], [[individualist anarchism]], andor [[red anarchism]]. There is also [[anarcho-capitalism]] which many anarchists feel is a misuse of the anarcho prefix.

While it might seem that anarchism implies a total lack of [[law]], most anarchists believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no [[hierarchies]] develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no [[rulers]], not no [[rules]].''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

The [[Anarchist Movement]] is generally considered to be allied with the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM), the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO), the [[Black Panthers]], and the [[Zapatistas]]. Anarchism is most popular in [[North America]], [[Western Europe]], and [[Japan]]. Within the United States, there are several third parties that have anarchist followings.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, the term anarchism was first introduced in the [[19th Century]].

=== The theory of Anarchism ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of [[social-communism]], with [[collective ownership]] of [[means of production]] and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any [[government]] [[authority]] or [[coercion]].

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Many anarchists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  Anarchists see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;. Opponents of this theory call adherents, &quot;super-capitalists&quot;. It is worth noting that anarchists are generally opposed to [[capitalism]], arguing that it inherently leads to totalitarianism...thus the belief that [[anarcho-capitalism]] is an [[oxymoron]]. Anarcho-capitalists tend to disagree strongly with anarchists as well, and the two viewpoints are strongly in opposition.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists support the [[American Revolution]] for totally different reason than Anarchists. Anarchists tend to argue that the American Revolution was betrayed much like the [[Russian Revolution]]. They argue that the capitalists fought the war, not for freedom of people, but for freedom of corporations. They note that a major incentive for individuals such as [[George Washington]] to revolt from [[England]] was that England was ordering the capitalists to halt the [[genocide]] against [[Native Americans]].

This split in thinking between the forces of the American Revolution led to the rise of the American [[Democratic Party]], [[Democratic-Republican Party]], [[Whig Party]], [[National Republican Party]], [[Old Republican Party]], [[Federalist Party]], and, of course, the [[Worker's Party]], [[Green Party]], [[Anti-Mason Party]], and [[Socialist Party]]. 

Anarchists loathe anarcho-capitalism as it opposes democracy.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected. In short, this is an emphasis on democracy.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The incorrect idea that political anarchy equates to absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by [[Durkheim]]'s sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that the government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without the nation-states.  

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Anarchism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  

=== [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] ===

[[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. The philosophy was popular amongst radical labor unions in the early twentieth century, notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories (the &quot;means of production&quot;).

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance.

Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarchists believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered by contract.

*  Anarchists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer, this is the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature.

*  Anarcho-capitalists, in return, argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

*Anarchists counter by noting that they are not against the idea of working but rather against the employer-employee relationship.


=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that anarchists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by most anarchists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  

The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  

=== [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] ===

[[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy. The philosophy was popular amongst radical labor unions in the early twentieth century, notably the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]. It advocated revolution via general strike and takeover of the factories (the &quot;means of production&quot;).

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

      <text xml:space="preserve">AfGhanistan was invaded and occupied by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1979. The USSR was forced to withdraw 10 years later by anti-communist mujahidin forces

supplied and trained by the US, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and others. Fighting subsequently continued among the various mujahidin factions, but the fundamentalist Islamic

Taliban movement has been able to seize most of the country. In addition to the continuing civil strife, the country suffers from enormous poverty, a crumbling infrastructure,

and widespread live mines.

&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=+3&gt;WELCOME TO CHRIS SLATER'S WEB SITE ON AUTISM&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;





&lt;P&gt;&lt;LEFT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=+0&gt;Hi! I'm Chris Slater, a 19 year old guy from Menominee, WI, at UW-Stout. I have High Functioning Autism. My page has been put up so I

can teach people about autism, and to help anyone with any questions about

autism. And you perhaps figured it out, I'm in college. :)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LEFT&gt;



&lt;P&gt;&lt;LEFT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT COLOR=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=+1&gt;When

I was younger, I had the same characteristics as any other person with

autism. Today, I'm very active. I have many friends, some have autism;

some don't. :-) I love to play Magic: The Gathering, a collectable card

game, and some of my friends without autism play it, also. I love to play

golf, but I &lt;U&gt;never&lt;/U&gt; play alone! What made this possible was that I

was &quot;educated&quot; about people that don't have autism. What I mean by that

is that I &lt;U&gt;learned&lt;/U&gt; how they interact, and how they present themselves.

I feel that every person with autism can, in fact, make it in this world

-- if they learn how to socialize! ;-)&lt;/LEFT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;



&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=+0&gt;Please click on any of the topics you would be interested

in...&lt;/FONT&gt;



&lt;P&gt;



&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=+0&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;overview.html&quot; TARGET=&quot;page&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/A&gt;

This is just an overview on what Autism is...&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;





&lt;P&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=+0&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;story.html&quot; TARGET=&quot;page&quot;&gt;That's

my story (And I'm sticking to it!)&lt;/A&gt; I also happened to be &lt;U&gt;very&lt;/U&gt;

advanced! In my own words, here's how I did it! :-)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;







&lt;P&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=+0&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;thoughts.html&quot; TARGET=&quot;page&quot;&gt;Thoughts

on Autism...&lt;/A&gt; This link will show you what I think about autism...&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;







&lt;P&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=+0&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;selfadvocate.html&quot; TARGET=&quot;page&quot;&gt;About

the self advocate...&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp; My thoughts on being a self advocate.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;





&lt;P&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=&quot;+0&quot;&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;nocure.html&quot; TARGET=&quot;page&quot;&gt;Anyone willing to cure autism is out of line!&lt;/A&gt; Why I think this,

backed with reason.  There is &lt;B&gt;no&lt;/B&gt; cure for autism.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;





&lt;P&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=+0&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;pages.html&quot; TARGET=&quot;page&quot;&gt;Personal

web pages...&lt;/A&gt; These are other pages about autism, created by other people

with autism.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;



&lt;P&gt;





&lt;P&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=+1&gt;Like becoming a more advanced person with autism,

this page is &lt;B&gt;always&lt;/B&gt; improving!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;

'''Autism''' is a pervasive developmental [[mental disorder]] involving problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It typically appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in 1 in 500 individuals and it is 4 times more prevalent in boys than girls.

Autism is treatable. Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.


A related disorder, [[Asperger's Disorder]], appears to be a milder form of autism. Autism is sometimes called Kanner's Autism, Disorder or Syndrome to distinguish it from Asperger's Disorder. Another term is Low-Functioning Autism for Kanner's and High-Functioning Autism for Asperger's.

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]].

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have suffered from autism to some degree. However, autism is more frequently found in individuals with [[learning disability|learning disabilities]]. 

Some things to mention here:
* the ''idiot savant'' phenomenon often seen in people with autism
* autism, asperger increasingly seen as a continuum of social capability
* recent research in the UK suggesting a link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]]
* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot; -- the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;

'''Autism''' is a pervasive developmental [[mental disorder]] involving problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It typically appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in 1 in 500 individuals and it is 4 times more prevalent in boys than girls.

Autism is treatable. Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

A related disorder, [[Asperger's Disorder]], appears to be a milder form of autism. Autism is sometimes called Kanner's Autism, Disorder or Syndrome to distinguish it from Asperger's Disorder. Another term is Low-Functioning Autism for Kanner's and High-Functioning Autism for Asperger's.

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]].  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Disfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our 5 senses.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have suffered from autism to some degree. However, autism is more frequently found in individuals with [[learning disability|learning disabilities]]. 

Some things to mention here:
* the ''idiot savant'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism
* autism, asperger increasingly seen as a continuum of social capability
* recent research in the UK suggesting a link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]]
* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot; -- the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;

'''Autism''' is a complex and pervasive developmental disorder that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] disability and not simply a psychiatric disorder, even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration.  Typically, it appears during the first three years of life.  It is estimated that it occurs in as many as 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals (from the Autism Society of America) and it is 4 times more prevalent in boys than girls. 

Autism is treatable. Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

A related disorder, [[Asperger's Syndrome]], appears to be a milder form of autism. Autism is sometimes called Kanner's Autism, Disorder or Syndrome to distinguish it from Asperger's Disorder. Another term is Low-Functioning Autism for Kanner's and High-Functioning Autism for Asperger's.

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]].  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Disfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our 5 senses.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have suffered from autism to some degree. However, autism is more frequently found in individuals with [[learning disability|learning disabilities]]. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.

Some things to mention here:
* the ''[[idiot savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism
* autism, asperger increasingly seen as a continuum of social capability
* recent research in the UK suggesting a link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]]
* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot; -- the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot; -- see [[theory of mind]]
* recent claims that autism is probably precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity ''(is there any confirmation for this in the mainstream medical literature?)'' &lt;!-- cite please! --&gt;

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life.

'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in as many as 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals (from The Autism Society of America:[[http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer]]), and it is 4 times more prevalent in boys than girls. 

Autism is treatable. Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

A related disorder, [[Asperger's Syndrome]], appears to be a milder form of autism. Autism is sometimes called Kanner's Autism, Disorder or Syndrome to distinguish it from Asperger's Disorder. Another term is Low-Functioning Autism for Kanner's and High-Functioning Autism for Asperger's.

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]].  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Disfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have suffered from autism to some degree. However, autism is more frequently found in individuals with [[learning disability|learning disabilities]]. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.

Some things to mention here:
* the ''[[idiot savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism
* autism, asperger increasingly seen as a continuum of social capability
* recent research in the UK suggesting a link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]]
* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot; -- the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot; -- see [[theory of mind]]
* recent claims that autism is probably precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity ''(is there any confirmation for this in the mainstream medical literature?)'' &lt;!-- cite please! --&gt;

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life.

A related disorder, [[Asperger's Syndrome]], appears to be a milder form of autism. Autism is sometimes called Kanner's Autism, Disorder or Syndrome to distinguish it from Asperger's Disorder. Another term is Low-Functioning Autism for Kanner's and High-Functioning Autism for Asperger's.



Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]].  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.



Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have suffered from autism to some degree. However, autism is more frequently found in individuals with [[learning disability|learning disabilities]]. 



There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%. 

Some things to mention here:

* the ''[[idiot savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* autism, asperger increasingly seen as a continuum of social capability

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]]

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot; -- the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot; -- see [[theory of mind]]

* recent claims that autism is probably precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity ''(is there any confirmation for this in the mainstream medical literature?)'' &lt;!-- cite please! --&gt;

* increasingly common claims of sucessful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy


Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life.

'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in as many as 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and it is 4 times more prevalent in boys than girls (from The Autism Society of America: http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer ).

Autism is treatable (but not curable). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

A related disorder, [[Asperger's Syndrome]], appears to be a milder form of autism. The chief difference between Kanner's Syndrome, or classical autism, and Aspergers' is that in Asperger's there is no significant delay in speech, and intelligence is average or above. In Kanner's autism there is a significant delay in language and usually lower-than average intelligence; Kanner's autism with IQ&lt;80 is referred to as &quot;low-functioning autism&quot;, while Kanner's with IQ&gt;80 is referred to as &quot;high functioning autism&quot;.

In Kanner's autism there is a significant delay in language and usually lower-than average intelligence; Kanner's autism with IQ&lt;80 is referred to as &quot;low-functioning autism&quot;, while Kanner's with IQ&gt;80 is referred to as &quot;high functioning autism&quot;. 

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have suffered from autism to some degree. However, autism is more frequently found in individuals with [[learning disability|learning disabilities]]. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%. 

Some things to mention here:

* the ''[[idiot savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* autism, asperger increasingly seen as a continuum of social capability

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]]

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot; -- the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot; -- see [[theory of mind]]

* recent claims that autism is probably precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity ''(is there any confirmation for this in the mainstream medical literature?)'' &lt;!-- cite please! --&gt;

* increasingly common claims of sucessful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life.

'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in as many as 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and it is 4 times more prevalent in males than females (from The Autism Society of America: http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer ).  It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

Autism is treatable (but not curable as of now, but there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

A related disorder, [[Asperger's Syndrome]], appears to be a milder form of autism.

'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in as many as 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and it is 4 times more prevalent in males than females (from The Autism Society of America: http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer ).  It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

Autism is treatable (but not curable as of now, although there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

A related disorder, [[Asperger's Syndrome]], is a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case. The chief difference between Kanner's Syndrome, or classical autism, and Aspergers' is that in Asperger's there is no significant delay in speech, and intelligence is average or above. In Kanner's autism there is a significant delay in language and usually lower-than average intelligence; Kanner's autism with IQ&lt;80 is referred to as &quot;low-functioning autism&quot;, while Kanner's with IQ&gt;80 is referred to as &quot;high functioning autism&quot;. 

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have suffered from autism to some degree. However, autism is more frequently found in individuals with [[learning disability|learning disabilities]]. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%. 

Some things to mention here:

* the ''[[idiot savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* autism, asperger increasingly seen as a continuum of social capability

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]]

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot; -- the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot; -- see [[theory of mind]]

* recent claims that autism is probably precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity ''(is there any confirmation for this in the mainstream medical literature?)'' &lt;!-- cite please! --&gt;

* increasingly common claims of sucessful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life.

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have suffered from autism to some degree. However, autism is more frequently found in individuals with [[learning disability|learning disabilities]]. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%. 

Some things to mention here:

* the ''[[idiot savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* autism, asperger increasingly seen as a continuum of social capability

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]]

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot; -- the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot; -- see [[theory of mind]]

* recent claims that autism is probably precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity ''(is there any confirmation for this in the mainstream medical literature?)'' &lt;!-- cite please! --&gt;

* increasingly common claims of sucessful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in as many as 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and it is 4 times more prevalent in males than females (from The Autism Society of America: http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer ).  It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

Autism is treatable (but not curable as of now, although there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

A related disorder, [[Asperger's Syndrome]], is a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case.

[[Asperger's Syndrome]] is thought to be a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case. The chief difference between Kanner's Syndrome, or classical autism, and Aspergers' is that in Asperger's there is no significant delay in speech, and intelligence is average or above. In Kanner's autism there is a significant delay in language and usually lower-than average intelligence; Kanner's autism with [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 is referred to as &quot;low-functioning autism&quot;, while Kanner's with IQ&amp;gt;80 is referred to as &quot;high functioning autism&quot;. 

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have suffered from autism to some degree. However, autism is more frequently found in individuals with [[learning disability|learning disabilities]]. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%. 

Some things to mention here:

* the ''[[idiot savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* autism, asperger increasingly seen as a continuum of social capability

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]]

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot; -- the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot; -- see [[theory of mind]]

* recent claims that autism is probably precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity ''(is there any confirmation for this in the mainstream medical literature?)'' &lt;!-- cite please! --&gt;

* increasingly common claims of sucessful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life. [[Donna Williams]]  (Autism:an inside-out approach, ISBN 1 85302 387 6) gives an interesting perspective  on the experience of the person with autism.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in as many as 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and it is 4 times more prevalent in males than females (from The Autism Society of America: http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer ).  It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

[[As of 2004]], autism is treatable, but not curable (although there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child. 

[[Asperger's syndrome]] is thought to be a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case. The chief difference between Kanner's Syndrome, or classical autism, and Asperger's is that in Asperger's there is no significant delay in speech, and intelligence is average or above. In Kanner's autism there is a significant delay in language and usually lower-than average intelligence; Kanner's autism with [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 is referred to as &quot;low-functioning autism&quot;, while Kanner's with IQ&amp;gt;80 is referred to as &quot;high functioning autism&quot;. 

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have suffered from autism to some degree. However, autism is more frequently found in individuals with [[learning disability|learning disabilities]]. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%. 

Some things to mention here:

* the ''[[idiot savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* autism, asperger increasingly seen as a continuum of social capability

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]]

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot;&amp;mdash;the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;&amp;mdash;see [[theory of mind]]

* recent claims that autism is probably precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity ''(is there any confirmation for this in the mainstream medical literature?)'' &lt;!-- cite please! --&gt;

* increasingly common claims of sucessful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy

* [[RDI]] is a treatment program targeting the core social/relationship deficits of autism

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life. [[Donna Williams]]  (''Autism: an inside-out approach'', ISBN 1 85302 387 6) gives an interesting perspective on the experience of the person with autism.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in as many as 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and it is 4 times more prevalent in males than females (source: The Autism Society of America [http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer]).  It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

[[As of 2004]], autism is treatable, but not curable (although there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child. 

[[Asperger's syndrome]] is thought to be a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case. The chief difference between Kanner's Syndrome, or classical autism, and Asperger's is that in Asperger's there is no significant delay in speech, and intelligence is average or above. In Kanner's autism there is a significant delay in language and usually lower-than average intelligence; Kanner's autism with [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 is referred to as &quot;low-functioning autism&quot;, while Kanner's with IQ&amp;gt;80 is referred to as &quot;high functioning autism&quot;. 

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have suffered from autism to some degree. However, autism is more frequently found in individuals with [[learning disability|learning disabilities]]. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%. 

Some things to mention here:

* the ''[[idiot savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* autism, asperger increasingly seen as a continuum of social capability

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]]

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot;&amp;mdash;the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;&amp;mdash;see [[theory of mind]]

It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

[[As of 2004]], autism is treatable, but not curable (although there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

== Severity of symptoms == 

Autism presents in a wide degree of severity, from those who nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remediated enough to appear unexceptional to acquaintances.

== &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High-funtioning&quot; ==

In terms of both classification and [[therapy]], autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 referred to as suffering from &quot;low-functioning autism&quot;, while those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high functioning autism&quot; (HFA).

== Asperger's and Kanner's syndrome ==

Of the most common presentations of autism, [[Kanner's syndrome]] is often described as classical autism, implying low-functioning, while [[Asperger's syndrome]] is described as a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case.

In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) the most significant difference between [[Autistic Disorder]] (Kanner's) and Asperger's Disorder is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm] while in these areas a diagnosis of Asperger's observes &quot;no clinically significant delay.&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm]

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's sufferers as a group tend to perform better than those with Autistic Disorder has fed the popular conception that ''Asperger's Syndrome'' is synonymous with HFA, or that it is a lesser disorder than ''autism''.

Autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with such severe cases as accurately presented in [[Rain Man]] is an encouragement for relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as suffering from Asperger's rather than autism.

== Autism as a spectrum disorder ==

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have suffered from autism to some degree. However, autism is more frequently found in individuals with [[learning disability|learning disabilities]]. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.

== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%. 

== Aspects of autism ==

Some things to mention here:

* the ''[[autistic savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* autism, asperger increasingly seen as a continuum of social capability

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]]

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot;&amp;mdash;the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;&amp;mdash;see [[theory of mind]]

* recent claims that autism is probably precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity ''(is there any confirmation for this in the mainstream medical literature?)'' &lt;!-- cite please! --&gt;

* increasingly common claims of successful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy

* [[RDI]] is a treatment program targeting the core social/relationship deficits of autism

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life as a person with autism. [[Donna Williams]]  (''Autism: an inside-out approach'', ISBN 1-85302-387-6) gives an interesting perspective on the experience of the person with autism.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in approximately 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and is 4 times more prevalent in males than females (source: The Autism Society of America [http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer]).  It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

[[As of 2004]], autism is treatable, but not curable (although there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

== Severity of symptoms == 

Autism presents in a wide degree of severity, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remediated enough to appear unexceptional to acquaintances.

== &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High-funtioning&quot; ==

In terms of both classification and [[therapy]], autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 referred to as suffering from &quot;low-functioning autism&quot;, while those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high functioning autism&quot; (HFA).

== Asperger's and Kanner's syndrome ==

Of the most common presentations of autism, [[Kanner's syndrome]] is often described as classical autism, implying low-functioning, while [[Asperger's syndrome]] is described as a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case.

In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) the most significant difference between [[Autistic Disorder]] (Kanner's) and Asperger's Disorder is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm] while in these areas a diagnosis of Asperger's observes &quot;no clinically significant delay.&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm]

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's sufferers as a group tend to perform better than those with Autistic Disorder has fed the popular conception that ''Asperger's Syndrome'' is synonymous with HFA, or that it is a lesser disorder than ''autism''.

Autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with such severe cases as accurately presented in [[Rain Man]] is an encouragement for relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as suffering from Asperger's rather than autism.

== Autism as a spectrum disorder ==

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have suffered from autism to some degree. However, autism is more frequently found in individuals with [[learning disability|learning disabilities]]. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.

== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%. 

== Aspects of autism ==

Some things to mention here:

* the ''[[autistic savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* autism, asperger increasingly seen as a continuum of social capability

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]]

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot;&amp;mdash;the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;&amp;mdash;see [[theory of mind]]

* recent claims that autism is probably precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity ''(is there any confirmation for this in the mainstream medical literature?)'' &lt;!-- cite please! --&gt;

* increasingly common claims of successful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy

* [[RDI]] is a treatment program targeting the core social/relationship deficits of autism

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life as a person with autism. [[Donna Williams]]  (''Autism: an inside-out approach'', ISBN 1-85302-387-6) gives an interesting perspective on the experience of the person with autism.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in approximately 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and is 4 times more prevalent in males than females (source: The Autism Society of America [http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer]).  It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

[[As of 2004]], autism is treatable, but not curable (although there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

== Severity of symptoms == 

Autism presents in a wide degree of severity, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remediated enough to appear unexceptional to acquaintances.

== &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High-functioning&quot; ==

In terms of both classification and [[therapy]], autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 referred to as suffering from &quot;low-functioning autism&quot;, while those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high functioning autism&quot; (HFA).

== Asperger's and Kanner's syndrome ==

Of the most common presentations of autism, [[Kanner's syndrome]] is often described as classical autism, implying low-functioning, while [[Asperger's syndrome]] is described as a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case.

In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) the most significant difference between [[Autistic Disorder]] (Kanner's) and Asperger's Disorder is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm] while in these areas a diagnosis of Asperger's observes &quot;no clinically significant delay.&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm]

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's sufferers as a group tend to perform better than those with Autistic Disorder has fed the popular conception that ''Asperger's Syndrome'' is synonymous with HFA, or that it is a lesser disorder than ''autism''.

Autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with such severe cases as accurately presented in [[Rain Man]] is an encouragement for relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as suffering from Asperger's rather than autism.

== Autism as a spectrum disorder ==

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have suffered from autism to some degree. However, autism is more frequently found in individuals with [[learning disability|learning disabilities]]. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.

== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%. 

== Aspects of autism ==

Some things to mention here:

* the ''[[autistic savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* autism, asperger increasingly seen as a continuum of social capability

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]]

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot;&amp;mdash;the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;&amp;mdash;see [[theory of mind]]

* recent claims that autism is probably precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity ''(is there any confirmation for this in the mainstream medical literature?)'' &lt;!-- cite please! --&gt;

* increasingly common claims of successful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy

* [[RDI]] is a treatment program targeting the core social/relationship deficits of autism

[[Donna Williams]]  (''Autism: an inside-out approach'', ISBN 1-85302-387-6) gives an interesting perspective on the experience of the person with autism.

Of the most common presentations of autism, [[Kanner's syndrome]] is often described as classical autism, implying low-functioning, while [[Asperger's syndrome]] is described as a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case.

In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) the most significant difference between [[Autistic Disorder]] (Kanner's) and Asperger's Disorder is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm] while in these areas a diagnosis of Asperger's observes &quot;no clinically significant delay.&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm]

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's sufferers as a group tend to perform better than those with Autistic Disorder has fed the popular conception that ''Asperger's Syndrome'' is synonymous with HFA, or that it is a lesser disorder than ''autism''.

Autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with such severe cases as accurately presented in [[Rain Man]] is an encouragement for relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as suffering from Asperger's rather than autism.

== Autism as a spectrum disorder ==

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have suffered from autism to some degree. However, autism is more frequently found in individuals with [[learning disability|learning disabilities]]. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.

== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%. 

== Aspects of autism ==

Some things to mention here:

* the ''[[autistic savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* autism, asperger increasingly seen as a continuum of social capability

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]]

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot;&amp;mdash;the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;&amp;mdash;see [[theory of mind]]

* recent claims that autism is probably precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity ''(is there any confirmation for this in the mainstream medical literature?)'' &lt;!-- cite please! --&gt;

* increasingly common claims of successful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy

* [[RDI]] is a treatment program targeting the core social/relationship deficits of autism

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life as a person with autism. [[Donna Williams]]  (''Autism: an inside-out approach'', ISBN 1-85302-387-6) gives an interesting perspective on the experience of the person with autism.

== Controversies in Autism ==

Controversy exists as to whether autism, particularly Asperger autism, is a disorder at all, or simply a variation in neurological hardwiring. Many autistics do not lack language skills and desire to speak for themselves about their experience. They do not desire a cure, but rather to be given opportunities to use their unique skills and perceptions in useful ways. Websites such as [http://www.autistics.org/] present their view. 

Their attitude is understandable when one discovers that the word &quot;autism&quot; is fast becoming misused to define shy, intellectually-oriented children who are not extroverted nor interested in sports, or who are slightly developmentally delayed. Parents who are desperate for a &quot;normal&quot; child may agree to all sorts of treatments, including electroshock therapy, neuroleptic and antidepressant medication, and behavioristic training -- which at its most extreme appears barbaric, to say the least.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in approximately 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and is 4 times more prevalent in males than females (source: The Autism Society of America [http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer]).  It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

[[As of 2004]], autism is treatable, but not curable (although there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

== Severity of symptoms == 

Autism presents in a wide degree of severity, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remediated enough to appear unexceptional to acquaintances.

== &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High-functioning&quot; ==

== &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High-functioning&quot; ==

In terms of both classification and [[therapy]], autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 referred to as having &quot;low-functioning autism&quot;, while those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high functioning autism&quot; (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living, rather than to IQ. 

== Asperger's and Kanner's syndrome ==

Of the most common presentations of autism, [[Kanner's syndrome]] is often described as classical autism, implying low-functioning, while [[Asperger's syndrome]] is described as a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case.

In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) the most significant difference between [[Autistic Disorder]] (Kanner's) and Asperger's Disorder is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm] while in these areas a diagnosis of Asperger's observes &quot;no clinically significant delay.&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm]

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with Autistic Disorder has fed the popular conception that ''Asperger's Syndrome'' is synonymous with HFA, or that it is a lesser disorder than ''autism''.

Autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately presented in [[Rain Man]] is an encouragement for relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as suffering from Asperger's rather than autism.

== Autism as a spectrum disorder ==

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have had some form of autism.  Autistic people may have other [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] such as dyslexia. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.

== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%.

In [[2001]], [[Wired Magazine]] published an interesting speculative article [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers_pr.html The Geek Syndrome] exploring the surge in apparent autism in [[Silicon Valley]]. This is only one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior. Shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism.

== Aspects of autism ==

Some things to mention here:

* Dr. [[Bruno Bettelheim]] and his belief that autism was linked to trauma in early childhood.  Parents of autistics were blamed for having caused their child's condition. His misguided treatments did nothing to help autistic children.

* the ''[[autistic savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* autism, asperger increasingly seen as a continuum of social capability

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]] and research in the US suggesting a similar link between autism and [[DPT vaccine]].

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot;&amp;mdash;the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;&amp;mdash;see [[theory of mind]]

* Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]]'s influential research and his book ''Infantile Autism'' (1967) which demonstrated that autism was not cased by childhood trauma or abuse, but by damage to certain areas of the brain, particularly the reticular formation which associates present sensory input with memories of past experiences. 

* recent claims, notably by Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]], that autism is probably precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity ''(is there any confirmation for this in the mainstream medical literature?)'' &lt;!-- cite please! --&gt;

* increasingly common claims of successful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy. Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]] is a foremost proponent of this method.

* [[RDI]] is a treatment program targeting the core social/relationship deficits of autism

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life as a person with autism. [[Donna Williams]]  (''Autism: an inside-out approach'', ISBN 1-85302-387-6) and her many other books give an interesting perspective on the experience of the person with autism.

== Controversies in Autism ==

Controversy exists as to whether autism, particularly Asperger autism, is a disorder at all, or simply a variation in neurological hardwiring. Many autistics do not lack language skills (some mute autistics such as Jasmine O'Neill write very well) and desire to speak for themselves about their experience. They do not desire a cure, but rather to be given opportunities to use their unique skills and perceptions in useful ways. Websites such as [http://www.autistics.org autistics.org] present their view. 

Their attitude is understandable when one discovers that the word &quot;autism&quot; is fast becoming misused to define shy, intellectually-oriented children who are not extroverted nor interested in sports, or who are slightly developmentally delayed (better autistic than retarded?). Parents who are desperate for a &quot;normal&quot; child may agree to all sorts of treatments, including electroshock therapy, neuroleptic and antidepressant medication, and behavioristic training -- which at its most extreme appears barbaric, to say the least.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in approximately 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and is 4 times more prevalent in males than females (source: The Autism Society of America [http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer]).  It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

[[As of 2004]], autism is treatable, but not curable (although there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

== Severity of symptoms == 

Autism presents in a wide degree of severity, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remediated enough to appear unexceptional to acquaintances.

== &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High-functioning&quot; ==

In terms of both classification and [[therapy]], autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 referred to as having &quot;low-functioning autism&quot;, while those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high functioning autism&quot; (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living, rather than to IQ. 

== Asperger's and Kanner's syndrome ==

Of the most common presentations of autism, [[Kanner's syndrome]] is often described as classical autism, implying low-functioning, while [[Asperger's syndrome]] is described as a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case.

In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) the most significant difference between [[Autistic Disorder]] (Kanner's) and Asperger's Disorder is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm] while in these areas a diagnosis of Asperger's observes &quot;no clinically significant delay.&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm]

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with Autistic Disorder has fed the popular conception that ''Asperger's Syndrome'' is synonymous with HFA, or that it is a lesser disorder than ''autism''.

Autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately presented in [[Rain Man]] is an encouragement for relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as suffering from Asperger's rather than autism.

== Autism as a spectrum disorder ==

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have had some form of autism.  Autistic people may have other [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] such as dyslexia. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in approximately 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and is 4 times more prevalent in males than females (source: The Autism Society of America [http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer]).  It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

[[As of 2004]], autism is treatable, but not curable (although there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

== Severity of symptoms == 

Autism presents in a wide degree of severity, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remediated enough to appear unexceptional to acquaintances.

== &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High-functioning&quot; ==

In terms of both classification and [[therapy]], autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 referred to as having &quot;low-functioning autism&quot;, while those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high functioning autism&quot; (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living, rather than to IQ. 

== Asperger's and Kanner's syndrome ==

Of the most common presentations of autism, [[Kanner's syndrome]] is often described as classical autism, implying low-functioning, while [[Asperger's syndrome]] is described as a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case.

In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) the most significant difference between [[Autistic Disorder]] (Kanner's) and Asperger's Disorder is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm] while in these areas a diagnosis of Asperger's observes &quot;no clinically significant delay.&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm]

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with Autistic Disorder has fed the popular conception that ''Asperger's Syndrome'' is synonymous with HFA, or that it is a lesser disorder than ''autism''.

Autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately presented in [[Rain Man]] is an encouragement for relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as suffering from Asperger's rather than autism.

== Autism as a spectrum disorder ==

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have had some form of autism.  Autistic people may have other [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] such as dyslexia. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.

== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%.

In [[2001]], [[Wired Magazine]] published an interesting speculative article [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers_pr.html The Geek Syndrome] exploring the surge in apparent autism in [[Silicon Valley]]. This is only one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior. Shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism.

== Aspects of autism ==

Some things to mention here:

* Dr. [[Bruno Bettelheim]] and his belief that autism was linked to trauma in early childhood.  Parents of autistics were blamed for having caused their child's condition. His misguided treatments did nothing to help autistic children.

* the ''[[autistic savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* autism, asperger increasingly seen as a continuum of social capability

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]] and research in the US suggesting a similar link between autism and [[DPT vaccine]].

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot;&amp;mdash;the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;&amp;mdash;see [[theory of mind]]

* Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]]'s influential research and his book ''Infantile Autism'' (1967) which demonstrated that autism was not cased by childhood trauma or abuse, but by damage to certain areas of the brain, particularly the [[reticular formation]] which associates present sensory input with memories of past experiences. 

* recent claims, notably by Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]], that autism is probably precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity ''(is there any confirmation for this in the mainstream medical literature?)'' &lt;!-- cite please! --&gt;

* increasingly common claims of successful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy. Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]] is a foremost proponent of this method.

* [[RDI]] is a treatment program targeting the core social/relationship deficits of autism

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life as a person with autism. [[Donna Williams]]  (''Autism: an inside-out approach'', ISBN 1-85302-387-6) and her many other books give an interesting perspective on the experience of the person with autism.

== Controversies in Autism ==

Controversy exists as to whether autism, particularly Asperger autism, is a disorder at all, or simply a variation in neurological hardwiring. Many autistics do not lack language skills (some mute autistics such as Jasmine O'Neill write very well) and desire to speak for themselves about their experience. They do not desire a cure, but rather to be given opportunities to use their unique skills and perceptions in useful ways. Websites such as [http://www.autistics.org autistics.org] present their view. 

Their attitude is understandable when one discovers that the word &quot;autism&quot; is fast becoming misused to define shy, intellectually-oriented children who are not extroverted nor interested in sports, or who are slightly developmentally delayed (better autistic than retarded?). Parents who are desperate for a &quot;normal&quot; child may agree to all sorts of treatments, including electroshock therapy, neuroleptic and antidepressant medication, and behavioristic training -- which at its most extreme appears barbaric, to say the least.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in approximately 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and is 4 times more prevalent in males than females (source: The Autism Society of America [http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer]).  It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

[[As of 2004]], autism is treatable, but not curable (although there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

== Severity of symptoms == 

Autism presents in a wide degree of severity, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remediated enough to appear unexceptional to acquaintances.

== &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High-functioning&quot; ==

In terms of both classification and [[therapy]], autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 referred to as having &quot;low-functioning autism&quot;, while those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high functioning autism&quot; (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living, rather than to IQ. 

== Asperger's and Kanner's syndrome ==

Of the most common presentations of autism, [[Kanner's syndrome]] is often described as classical autism, implying low-functioning, while [[Asperger's syndrome]] is described as a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case.

In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) the most significant difference between [[Autistic Disorder]] (Kanner's) and Asperger's Disorder is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm] while in these areas a diagnosis of Asperger's observes &quot;no clinically significant delay.&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm]

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with Autistic Disorder has fed the popular conception that ''Asperger's Syndrome'' is synonymous with HFA, or that it is a lesser disorder than ''autism''.

Autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately presented in [[Rain Man]] is an encouragement for relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as suffering from Asperger's rather than autism.

== Autism as a spectrum disorder ==

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have had some form of autism.  Autistic people may have other [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] such as dyslexia. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.

== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%.

In [[2001]], [[Wired Magazine]] published an interesting speculative article [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers_pr.html The Geek Syndrome] exploring the surge in apparent autism in [[Silicon Valley]]. This is only one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior. Shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism.

== Aspects of autism ==

Some things to mention here:

* Dr. [[Bruno Bettelheim]] and his belief that autism was linked to trauma in early childhood.  Parents of autistics were blamed for having caused their child's condition. His misguided treatments did nothing to help autistic children.  It should be noted that [[Leo Kanner]] was the person who originated the concept of &quot;refrigerator mothers&quot; when it came to autism, although he eventually renounced it.  Bettelheim only took the theory further.

* the ''[[autistic savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* autism, asperger increasingly seen as a continuum of social capability

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]] and research in the US suggesting a similar link between autism and [[DPT vaccine]].

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot;&amp;mdash;the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;&amp;mdash;see [[theory of mind]]

* Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]]'s influential research and his book ''Infantile Autism'' (1967) which demonstrated that autism was not cased by childhood trauma or abuse, but by damage to certain areas of the brain, particularly the [[reticular formation]] which associates present sensory input with memories of past experiences. 

* recent claims, notably by Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]], that autism is probably precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity ''(is there any confirmation for this in the mainstream medical literature?)'' &lt;!-- cite please! --&gt;

* increasingly common claims of successful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy. Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]] is a foremost proponent of this method.

* [[RDI]] is a treatment program targeting the core social/relationship deficits of autism

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life as a person with autism. [[Donna Williams]]  (''Autism: an inside-out approach'', ISBN 1-85302-387-6) and her many other books give an interesting perspective on the experience of the person with autism.

== Controversies in Autism ==

Controversy exists as to whether autism, particularly Asperger autism, is a disorder at all, or simply a variation in neurological hardwiring. Many autistics do not lack language skills (some mute autistics such as Jasmine O'Neill write very well) and desire to speak for themselves about their experience. They do not desire a cure, but rather to be given opportunities to use their unique skills and perceptions in useful ways. Websites such as [http://www.autistics.org autistics.org] present their view. 

Their attitude is understandable when one discovers that the word &quot;autism&quot; is fast becoming misused to define shy, intellectually-oriented children who are not extroverted nor interested in sports, or who are slightly developmentally delayed (better autistic than retarded?).  But it should also not lightly be assumed on the basis of Internet writing skill that autistic people presenting this point of view represent a misdiagnosed group -- many have been diagnosed correctly, are not simply shy or introverted, experience severe problems in functioning, but find that autism is still too much of an intrinsic part of themselves to want to have it eradicated in the name of normalcy.  Parents who are desperate for a &quot;normal&quot; child may agree to all sorts of treatments, including electroshock therapy, neuroleptic and antidepressant medication, and behavioristic training -- which at its most extreme appears barbaric, to say the least.

In [[2001]], [[Wired Magazine]] published an interesting speculative article [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers_pr.html The Geek Syndrome] exploring the surge in apparent autism in [[Silicon Valley]]. This is only one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior. Shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism.

== Aspects of autism ==

Some things to mention here:

* Dr. [[Bruno Bettelheim]] and his belief that autism was linked to trauma in early childhood.  Parents of autistics were blamed for having caused their child's condition. His misguided treatments did nothing to help autistic children.  It should be noted that [[Leo Kanner]] was the person who originated the concept of &quot;refrigerator mothers&quot; when it came to autism, although he eventually renounced it.  Bettelheim only took the theory further.

* the ''[[autistic savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* autism, asperger increasingly seen as a continuum of social capability

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]] and research in the US suggesting a similar link between autism and [[DPT vaccine]].

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot;&amp;mdash;the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;&amp;mdash;see [[theory of mind]]

* Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]]'s influential research and his book ''Infantile Autism'' (1967) which demonstrated that autism was not cased by childhood trauma or abuse, but by damage to certain areas of the brain, particularly the [[reticular formation]] which associates present sensory input with memories of past experiences. 

* recent claims, notably by Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]], that autism is probably precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity ''(is there any confirmation for this in the mainstream medical literature?)'' &lt;!-- cite please! --&gt;

* increasingly common claims of successful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy. Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]] is a foremost proponent of this method.

* [[RDI]] is a treatment program targeting the core social/relationship deficits of autism

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life as a person with autism. [[Donna Williams]]  (''Autism: an inside-out approach'', ISBN 1-85302-387-6) and her many other books give an interesting perspective on the experience of the person with autism.

== Controversies in Autism ==

Controversy exists as to whether autism, particularly Asperger autism, is a disorder at all, or simply a variation in neurological hardwiring. Many autistics do not lack language skills (some mute autistics such as Jasmine O'Neill write very well) and desire to speak for themselves about their experience. They do not desire a cure, but rather to be given opportunities to use their unique skills and perceptions in useful ways. Websites such as [http://www.autistics.org autistics.org] present their view. 

Their attitude is understandable when one discovers that the word &quot;autism&quot; is fast becoming misused to define shy, intellectually-oriented children who are not extroverted nor interested in sports, or who are slightly developmentally delayed (better autistic than retarded?).  But it should also not lightly be assumed on the basis of Internet writing skill that autistic people presenting this point of view represent a misdiagnosed group -- many have been diagnosed correctly, are not simply shy or introverted, experience severe problems in functioning, but find that autism is still too much of an intrinsic part of themselves to want to have it indiscriminately eradicated in the name of normalcy.  Parents who are desperate for a &quot;normal&quot; child may agree to all sorts of treatments, including electroshock therapy, neuroleptic and antidepressant medication, and behavioristic training -- which at its most extreme appears barbaric, to say the least.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in approximately 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and is 4 times more prevalent in males than females (source: The Autism Society of America [http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer]).  It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

[[As of 2004]], autism is treatable, but not curable (although there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

== Severity of symptoms == 

Autism presents in a wide degree of severity, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remediated enough to appear unexceptional to acquaintances.

== &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High-functioning&quot; ==

In terms of both classification and [[therapy]], autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 referred to as having &quot;low-functioning autism&quot;, while those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high functioning autism&quot; (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living, rather than to IQ.  This discrepancy can lead to confusion among service providers who equate IQ with functioning and may refuse to serve high-IQ autistic people who are severely compromised in their ability to perform daily living tasks.

== Asperger's and Kanner's syndrome ==

Of the most common presentations of autism, [[Kanner's syndrome]] is often described as classical autism, implying low-functioning, while [[Asperger's syndrome]] is described as a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case.

In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) the most significant difference between [[Autistic Disorder]] (Kanner's) and Asperger's Disorder is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm] while in these areas a diagnosis of Asperger's observes &quot;no clinically significant delay.&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm]

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with Autistic Disorder has fed the popular conception that ''Asperger's Syndrome'' is synonymous with HFA, or that it is a lesser disorder than ''autism''.

Autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately presented in [[Rain Man]] is an encouragement for relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as suffering from Asperger's rather than autism.

== Autism as a spectrum disorder ==

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have had some form of autism.  Autistic people may have other [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] such as dyslexia. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.  There are also cases of children developing abnormally from birth but regressing around the age of 18 months, causing some degree of controversy as to when the neurological difference involved in autism truly began.

== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%.

In [[2001]], [[Wired Magazine]] published an interesting speculative article [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers_pr.html The Geek Syndrome] exploring the surge in apparent autism in [[Silicon Valley]]. This is only one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior. Shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in approximately 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and is 4 times more prevalent in males than females (source: The Autism Society of America [http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer]).  It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

[[As of 2004]], autism is treatable, but not curable (although there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

== Severity of symptoms == 

Autism presents in a wide degree of severity, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remediated enough to appear unexceptional to acquaintances.

== &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High-functioning&quot; ==

In terms of both classification and [[therapy]], autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 referred to as having &quot;low-functioning autism&quot; (LFA), while those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high functioning autism&quot; (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living, rather than to IQ.  

This discrepancy can lead to confusion among service providers who equate IQ with functioning and may refuse to serve high-IQ autistic people who are severely compromised in their ability to perform daily living tasks, or may fail to recognize the intellectual potential of many autistic people who are considered LFA.

== Asperger's and Kanner's syndrome ==

Of the most common presentations of autism, [[Kanner's syndrome]] is often described as classical autism, implying low-functioning, while [[Asperger's syndrome]] is described as a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case.

In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) the most significant difference between [[Autistic Disorder]] (Kanner's) and Asperger's Disorder is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm] while in these areas a diagnosis of Asperger's observes &quot;no clinically significant delay.&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm]

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with Autistic Disorder has fed the popular conception that ''Asperger's Syndrome'' is synonymous with HFA, or that it is a lesser disorder than ''autism''.

Autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately presented in [[Rain Man]] is an encouragement for relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as suffering from Asperger's rather than autism.

== Autism as a spectrum disorder ==

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have had some form of autism.  Autistic people may have other [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] such as dyslexia. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.  There are also cases of children developing abnormally from birth but regressing around the age of 18 months, causing some degree of controversy as to when the neurological difference involved in autism truly began.

== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%.

In [[2001]], [[Wired Magazine]] published an interesting speculative article [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers_pr.html The Geek Syndrome] exploring the surge in apparent autism in [[Silicon Valley]]. This is only one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior. Shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism.

== Aspects of autism ==

Some things to mention here:

* Dr. [[Bruno Bettelheim]] and his belief that autism was linked to trauma in early childhood.  Parents of autistics were blamed for having caused their child's condition. His misguided treatments did nothing to help autistic children.  It should be noted that [[Leo Kanner]] was the person who originated the concept of &quot;refrigerator mothers&quot; when it came to autism, although he eventually renounced it.  Bettelheim only took the theory further.

* the ''[[autistic savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* autism, asperger increasingly seen as a continuum of social capability

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]] and research in the US suggesting a similar link between autism and [[DPT vaccine]].

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot;&amp;mdash;the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;&amp;mdash;see [[theory of mind]]

* Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]]'s influential research and his book ''Infantile Autism'' (1967) which demonstrated that autism was not cased by childhood trauma or abuse, but by damage to certain areas of the brain, particularly the [[reticular formation]] which associates present sensory input with memories of past experiences. 

* recent claims, notably by Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]], that autism is probably precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity ''(is there any confirmation for this in the mainstream medical literature?)'' &lt;!-- cite please! --&gt;

* increasingly common claims of successful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy. Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]] is a foremost proponent of this method.

* [[RDI]] is a treatment program targeting the core social/relationship deficits of autism

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life as a person with autism. [[Donna Williams]]  (''Autism: an inside-out approach'', ISBN 1-85302-387-6) and her many other books give an interesting perspective on the experience of the person with autism.  Dozens of other autistic people have also written books on autism and other topics.

== Controversies in Autism ==

Controversy exists as to whether autism, particularly Asperger autism, is a disorder at all, or simply a variation in neurological hardwiring. Many autistics do not lack language skills (some mute autistics such as Jasmine O'Neill write very well) and desire to speak for themselves about their experience. They do not desire a cure, but rather to be given opportunities to use their unique skills and perceptions in useful ways. Websites such as [http://www.autistics.org autistics.org] present their view. 

Their attitude is understandable when one discovers that the word &quot;autism&quot; is fast becoming misused to define shy, intellectually-oriented children who are not extroverted nor interested in sports, or who are slightly developmentally delayed (better autistic than retarded?).  But it should also not lightly be assumed on the basis of Internet writing skill that autistic people presenting this point of view represent a misdiagnosed group -- many have been diagnosed correctly, are not simply shy or introverted, experience severe problems in functioning, but find that autism is still too much of an intrinsic part of themselves to want to have it indiscriminately eradicated in the name of normalcy.  Parents who are desperate for a &quot;normal&quot; child may agree to all sorts of treatments, including electroshock therapy, neuroleptic and antidepressant medication, and behavioristic training -- which at its most extreme appears barbaric, to say the least.

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life as a person with autism. [[Donna Williams]]  (''Autism: an inside-out approach'', ISBN 1-85302-387-6) and her many other books give an interesting perspective on the experience of the person with autism.  Dozens of other autistic people have also written books on autism and other topics.

== Controversies in Autism ==

Controversy exists as to whether autism, particularly Asperger autism, is a disorder at all, or simply a variation in neurological hardwiring. Many autistics do not lack language skills (some mute autistics such as Jasmine O'Neill write very well) and desire to speak for themselves about their experience. They do not desire a cure, but rather to be given opportunities to use their unique skills and perceptions in useful ways. Websites such as [http://www.autistics.org autistics.org] present their view. 

Their attitude is understandable when one discovers that the word &quot;autism&quot; is fast becoming misused to define shy, intellectually-oriented children who are not extroverted nor interested in sports, or who are slightly developmentally delayed (better autistic than retarded?).  But it should also not lightly be assumed on the basis of Internet writing skill that autistic people presenting this point of view represent a misdiagnosed group -- many have been diagnosed correctly, are not simply shy or introverted, experience severe problems in functioning, but find that autism is still too much of an intrinsic part of themselves to want to have it indiscriminately eradicated in the name of normalcy.  Parents who are desperate for a &quot;normal&quot; child may agree to all sorts of treatments, including electroshock therapy, neuroleptic and antidepressant medication, and behavioristic training -- which at its most extreme appears barbaric, to say the least.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in approximately 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and is 4 times more prevalent in males than females (source: The Autism Society of America [http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer]).  It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

[[As of 2004]], autism is treatable, but not curable (although there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

== Severity of symptoms == 

Autism presents in a wide degree of severity, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remediated enough to appear unexceptional to acquaintances.

== &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High-functioning&quot; ==

In terms of both classification and [[therapy]], autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 referred to as having &quot;low-functioning autism&quot; (LFA), while those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high functioning autism&quot; (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living, rather than to IQ.  

This discrepancy can lead to confusion among service providers who equate IQ with functioning and may refuse to serve high-IQ autistic people who are severely compromised in their ability to perform daily living tasks, or may fail to recognize the intellectual potential of many autistic people who are considered LFA.

== Asperger's and Kanner's syndrome ==

Of the most common presentations of autism, [[Kanner's syndrome]] is often described as classical autism, implying low-functioning, while [[Asperger's syndrome]] is described as a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case.

In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) the most significant difference between [[Autistic Disorder]] (Kanner's) and Asperger's Disorder is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm] while in these areas a diagnosis of Asperger's observes &quot;no clinically significant delay.&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm]

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with Autistic Disorder has fed the popular conception that ''Asperger's Syndrome'' is synonymous with HFA, or that it is a lesser disorder than ''autism''.  There is also a popular but untrue conception that autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning are automatically ''Asperger's Syndrome'', or that both are merely geeks with a medical label attached.

Autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately presented in [[Rain Man]] is an encouragement for relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as suffering from Asperger's rather than autism.

== Autism as a spectrum disorder ==

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have had some form of autism.  Autistic people may have other [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] such as dyslexia. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.  There are also cases of children developing abnormally from birth but regressing around the age of 18 months, causing some degree of controversy as to when the neurological difference involved in autism truly began.

== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%.

In [[2001]], [[Wired Magazine]] published an interesting speculative article [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers_pr.html The Geek Syndrome] exploring the surge in apparent autism in [[Silicon Valley]]. This is only one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior. Shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism.

== Aspects of autism ==

Some things to mention here:

* Dr. [[Bruno Bettelheim]] and his belief that autism was linked to trauma in early childhood.  Parents of autistics were blamed for having caused their child's condition. His misguided treatments did nothing to help autistic children.  It should be noted that [[Leo Kanner]] was the person who originated the concept of &quot;refrigerator mothers&quot; when it came to autism, although he eventually renounced it.  Bettelheim only took the theory further.

* the ''[[autistic savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* autism, asperger increasingly seen as a continuum of social capability

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]] and research in the US suggesting a similar link between autism and [[DPT vaccine]].

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot;&amp;mdash;the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;&amp;mdash;see [[theory of mind]]

* Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]]'s influential research and his book ''Infantile Autism'' (1967) which demonstrated that autism was not cased by childhood trauma or abuse, but by damage to certain areas of the brain, particularly the [[reticular formation]] which associates present sensory input with memories of past experiences. 

* recent claims, notably by Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]], that autism is probably precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity ''(is there any confirmation for this in the mainstream medical literature?)'' &lt;!-- cite please! --&gt;

* increasingly common claims of successful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy. Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]] is a foremost proponent of this method.

* [[RDI]] is a treatment program targeting the core social/relationship deficits of autism

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life as a person with autism. [[Donna Williams]]  (''Autism: an inside-out approach'', ISBN 1-85302-387-6) and her many other books give an interesting perspective on the experience of the person with autism.

Controversy exists as to whether autism, particularly (but by no means limited to) Asperger autism, is a disorder at all, or simply a variation in neurological hardwiring. Many autistics do not lack language skills (some mute autistics such as Jasmine O'Neill write very well) and desire to speak for themselves about their experience. They do not desire a cure, but rather to be given opportunities to use their unique skills and perceptions in useful ways. Websites such as [http://www.autistics.org autistics.org] present their view. 

Their attitude is understandable when one discovers that the word &quot;autism&quot; is fast becoming misused to define shy, intellectually-oriented children who are not extroverted nor interested in sports, or who are slightly developmentally delayed (better autistic than retarded?).  But it should also not lightly be assumed that autistic people presenting this point of view represent a misdiagnosed group -- many have been diagnosed correctly, are not simply shy or introverted, experience severe problems in day to day functioning, but find that autism is still too much of an intrinsic part of themselves to want to have it indiscriminately eradicated in the name of normalcy.

Thus, it should also not lightly be assumed that autistic people presenting this point of view represent a misdiagnosed group.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in approximately 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and is 4 times more prevalent in males than females (source: The Autism Society of America [http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer]).  It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

[[As of 2004]], autism is treatable, but not curable (although there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

== Severity of symptoms == 

Autism presents in a wide degree of severity, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remediated enough to appear unexceptional to acquaintances.

== &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High-functioning&quot; ==

In terms of both classification and [[therapy]], autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 referred to as having &quot;low-functioning autism&quot; (LFA), while those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high functioning autism&quot; (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living, rather than to IQ.  

This discrepancy can lead to confusion among service providers who equate IQ with functioning and may refuse to serve high-IQ autistic people who are severely compromised in their ability to perform daily living tasks, or may fail to recognize the intellectual potential of many autistic people who are considered LFA.

== Asperger's and Kanner's syndrome ==

Of the most common presentations of autism, [[Kanner's syndrome]] is often described as classical autism, implying low-functioning, while [[Asperger's syndrome]] is described as a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case.

In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) the most significant difference between [[Autistic Disorder]] (Kanner's) and Asperger's Disorder is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm] while in these areas a diagnosis of Asperger's observes &quot;no clinically significant delay.&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm]

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with Autistic Disorder has fed the popular conception that ''Asperger's Syndrome'' is synonymous with HFA, or that it is a lesser disorder than ''autism''.  There is also a popular but untrue conception that autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning are automatically ''Asperger's Syndrome'', or that both are merely geeks with a medical label attached.

Autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately presented in [[Rain Man]] is an encouragement for relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as suffering from Asperger's rather than autism.

== Autism as a spectrum disorder ==

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have had some form of autism.  Autistic people may have other [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] such as dyslexia. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.  There are also cases of children developing abnormally from birth but regressing around the age of 18 months, causing some degree of controversy as to when the neurological difference involved in autism truly began.

== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%.

In [[2001]], [[Wired Magazine]] published an interesting speculative article [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers_pr.html The Geek Syndrome] exploring the surge in apparent autism in [[Silicon Valley]]. This is only one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior. Shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism.

== Aspects of autism ==

Some things to mention here:

* Dr. [[Bruno Bettelheim]] and his belief that autism was linked to trauma in early childhood.  Parents of autistics were blamed for having caused their child's condition. His misguided treatments did nothing to help autistic children.  It should be noted that [[Leo Kanner]] was the person who originated the concept of &quot;refrigerator mothers&quot; when it came to autism, although he eventually renounced it.  Bettelheim only took the theory further.

* the ''[[autistic savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* autism, asperger increasingly seen as a continuum of social capability

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]] and research in the US suggesting a similar link between autism and [[DPT vaccine]].

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot;&amp;mdash;the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;&amp;mdash;see [[theory of mind]]

* Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]]'s influential research and his book ''Infantile Autism'' (1967) which demonstrated that autism was not cased by childhood trauma or abuse, but by damage to certain areas of the brain, particularly the [[reticular formation]] which associates present sensory input with memories of past experiences. 

* recent claims, notably by Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]], that autism is probably precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity ''(is there any confirmation for this in the mainstream medical literature?)'' &lt;!-- cite please! --&gt;

* increasingly common claims of successful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy. Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]] is a foremost proponent of this method.

* [[RDI]] is a treatment program targeting the core social/relationship deficits of autism

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life as a person with autism. [[Donna Williams]]  (''Autism: an inside-out approach'', ISBN 1-85302-387-6) and her many other books give an interesting perspective on the experience of the person with autism.  Dozens of other autistic people have also written books on autism and other topics.

== Controversies in Autism ==

Controversy exists as to whether autism, particularly (but by no means limited to) Asperger autism, is a disorder at all, or simply a variation in neurological hardwiring. Many autistics do not lack language skills (some mute autistics such as Jasmine O'Neill write very well) and desire to speak for themselves about their experience. They do not desire a cure, but rather to be given opportunities to use their unique skills and perceptions in useful ways. Websites such as [http://www.autistics.org autistics.org] present their view. 

Some people understand this attitude as an outgrowth of their perception that the word &quot;autism&quot; is fast becoming misused to define shy, intellectually-oriented children who are not extroverted nor interested in sports, or who are slightly developmentally delayed (better autistic than retarded?).  However, the original autistic people to popularize the view that autistic people need not be cured, of whom one of the most famous is Jim Sinclair, were diagnosed in a time when autism was a decidedly unpopular diagnosis.  Thus, it should also not lightly be assumed that autistic people presenting this point of view represent a misdiagnosed group.  Many have been diagnosed correctly, are not simply shy or introverted geeks with a few social quirks, experience severe problems in day to day functioning, but find that autism is still too much of an intrinsic part of themselves to want to have it indiscriminately eradicated in the name of normalcy.   Parents who are desperate for a &quot;normal&quot; child may agree to all sorts of treatments, including electroshock therapy, neuroleptic and antidepressant medication, and behavioristic training -- which at its most extreme appears barbaric, to say the least.

This is only one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior. Shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism.

== Aspects of autism ==

Some things to mention here:

* Dr. [[Bruno Bettelheim]] and his belief that autism was linked to trauma in early childhood.  Parents of autistics were blamed for having caused their child's condition. His misguided treatments did nothing to help autistic children.  It should be noted that [[Leo Kanner]] was the person who originated the concept of &quot;refrigerator mothers&quot; when it came to autism, although he eventually renounced it.  Bettelheim only took the theory further.

* the ''[[autistic savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* autism, asperger increasingly seen as a continuum of social capability

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]] and research in the US suggesting a similar link between autism and [[DPT vaccine]].

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot;&amp;mdash;the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;&amp;mdash;see [[theory of mind]]

* Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]]'s influential research and his book ''Infantile Autism'' (1967) which demonstrated that autism was not caused by childhood trauma or abuse, but by damage to certain areas of the brain, particularly the [[reticular formation]] which associates present sensory input with memories of past experiences. 

* recent claims, notably by Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]], that autism is probably precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity ''(is there any confirmation for this in the mainstream medical literature?)'' &lt;!-- cite please! --&gt;

* increasingly common claims of successful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy. Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]] is a foremost proponent of this method.

* [[RDI]] is a treatment program targeting the core social/relationship deficits of autism

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life as a person with autism. [[Donna Williams]]  (''Autism: an inside-out approach'', ISBN 1-85302-387-6) and her many other books give an interesting perspective on the experience of the person with autism.  Dozens of other autistic people have also written books on autism and other topics.

== Controversies in Autism ==

Controversy exists as to whether autism, particularly (but by no means limited to) Asperger autism, is a disorder at all, or simply a variation in neurological hardwiring. Many autistics do not lack language skills (some mute autistics such as Jasmine O'Neill write very well) and desire to speak for themselves about their experience. They do not desire a cure, but rather to be given opportunities to use their unique skills and perceptions in useful ways. Websites such as [http://www.autistics.org autistics.org] present their view. 

Some people understand this attitude as an outgrowth of their perception that the word &quot;autism&quot; is fast becoming misused to define shy, intellectually-oriented children who are not extroverted nor interested in sports, or who are slightly developmentally delayed (better autistic than retarded?).  However, the original autistic people to popularize the view that autistic people need not be cured, of whom one of the most famous is Jim Sinclair, were diagnosed in a time when autism was a decidedly unpopular diagnosis.  Thus, it should also not lightly be assumed that autistic people presenting this point of view represent a misdiagnosed group.  Many have been diagnosed correctly, are not simply shy or introverted geeks with a few social quirks, experience severe problems in day to day functioning, but find that autism is still too much of an intrinsic part of themselves to want to have it indiscriminately eradicated in the name of normalcy.   Parents who are desperate for a &quot;normal&quot; child may agree to all sorts of treatments, including electroshock therapy, neuroleptic and antidepressant medication, and behavioristic training -- which at its most extreme appears barbaric, to say the least.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in approximately 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and is 4 times more prevalent in males than females (source: The Autism Society of America [http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer]).  It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

[[As of 2004]], autism is treatable, but not curable (although there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

== Severity of symptoms == 

Autism presents in a wide degree of severity, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remediated enough to appear unexceptional to acquaintances.

== &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High-functioning&quot; ==

In terms of both classification and [[therapy]], autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 referred to as having &quot;low-functioning autism&quot; (LFA), while those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high functioning autism&quot; (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living, rather than to IQ.  

This discrepancy can lead to confusion among service providers who equate IQ with functioning and may refuse to serve high-IQ autistic people who are severely compromised in their ability to perform daily living tasks, or may fail to recognize the intellectual potential of many autistic people who are considered LFA.

== Asperger's and Kanner's syndrome ==

Of the most common presentations of autism, [[Kanner's syndrome]] is often described as classical autism, implying low-functioning, while [[Asperger's syndrome]] is described as a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case.

In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) the most significant difference between [[Autistic Disorder]] (Kanner's) and Asperger's Disorder is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm] while in these areas a diagnosis of Asperger's observes &quot;no clinically significant delay.&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm]

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with Autistic Disorder has fed the popular conception that ''Asperger's Syndrome'' is synonymous with HFA, or that it is a lesser disorder than ''autism''.  There is also a popular but untrue conception that autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning are automatically ''Asperger's Syndrome'', or that both are merely geeks with a medical label attached.

Autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately presented in [[Rain Man]] is an encouragement for relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as suffering from Asperger's rather than autism.

== Autism as a spectrum disorder ==

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have had some form of autism.  Autistic people may have other [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] such as dyslexia. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.  There are also cases of children developing abnormally from birth but regressing around the age of 18 months, causing some degree of controversy as to when the neurological difference involved in autism truly began.

== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%.

In [[2001]], [[Wired Magazine]] published an interesting speculative article [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers_pr.html The Geek Syndrome] exploring the surge in apparent autism in [[Silicon Valley]]. This is only one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in approximately 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and is 4 times more prevalent in males than females (source: The Autism Society of America [http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer]).  It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

[[As of 2004]], autism is treatable, but not curable (although there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

== Severity of symptoms == 

Autism presents in a wide degree of severity, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remediated enough to appear unexceptional to acquaintances.

== &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High-functioning&quot; ==

In terms of both classification and [[therapy]], autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 referred to as having &quot;low-functioning autism&quot; (LFA), while those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high functioning autism&quot; (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living, rather than to IQ.  

This discrepancy can lead to confusion among service providers who equate IQ with functioning and may refuse to serve high-IQ autistic people who are severely compromised in their ability to perform daily living tasks, or may fail to recognize the intellectual potential of many autistic people who are considered LFA.

== Asperger's and Kanner's syndrome ==

Of the most common presentations of autism, [[Kanner's syndrome]] is often described as classical autism, implying low-functioning, while [[Asperger's syndrome]] is described as a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case.

In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) the most significant difference between [[Autistic Disorder]] (Kanner's) and Asperger's Disorder is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm] while in these areas a diagnosis of Asperger's observes &quot;no clinically significant delay.&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm]

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with Autistic Disorder has fed the popular conception that ''Asperger's Syndrome'' is synonymous with HFA, or that it is a lesser disorder than ''autism''.  There is also a popular but untrue conception that autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning are automatically ''Asperger's Syndrome'', or that both are merely geeks with a medical label attached.

Autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately presented in [[Rain Man]] is an encouragement for relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as suffering from Asperger's rather than autism.

== Autism as a spectrum disorder ==

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have had some form of autism.  Autistic people may have other [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] such as dyslexia. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.  There are also cases of children developing abnormally from birth but regressing around the age of 18 months, causing some degree of controversy as to when the neurological difference involved in autism truly began.

== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%.

In [[2001]], [[Wired Magazine]] published an interesting speculative article [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers_pr.html The Geek Syndrome] exploring the surge in apparent autism in [[Silicon Valley]]. This is only one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior. Shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism.

== Remediation of autistic behaviors ==

Remediation of debilitating aspects of autism was long hindered not only by widespread disagreement over its nature and causes, but by lack of a recognized and effective course of therapy.

Dr. [[Bruno Bettelheim]] believed that autism was linked to trauma in early childhood, and his work was highly influential for decades.  Parents, and especially mothers, of autistics were blamed for having caused their child's condition through the withholding of affection. [[Leo Kanner]], who first described autism (''Autistic disturbances of affective contact'', 1943) originated the concept of &quot;refrigerator mothers&quot; in regard to autism, although he eventually renounced the concept.  Bettelheim took the theory further. These theories did nothing to address the fact that having more than one autistic child in a family is exceptional, not the rule.  Treatments based on these theories failed to help autistic children.

A major breakthrough in the remediation of autistic behaviors came through work spearheaded by [[Ole Ivar Lovaas]], who believed that success could be obtained by behavioral approaches.
:''Lovaas' approaches&amp;mdash;often referred to as Discrete Trial, Intensive Behavior Intervention, and Applied Behavior Analysis&amp;mdash;are some of the best known and most widely used in the field and focus on the development of attention, imitation, receptive or expressive language, and pre-academic and self-help skills. Using a one-to-one therapist-child ratio and the “antecedent-behavior-consequence” (ABC) model, interventions based on this work involve trials or tasks. Each consists of (a) an antecedent, which is a directive or request for the child to perform an action; (b) a behavior, or response from the child, which may be categorized as successful performance, noncompliance, or no response; and (c) a consequence, defined as the reaction from the therapist, which ranges from strong positive reinforcement to a strong negative response, “No!”''(Autism Society of America, 2001).[http://www.aann.org/ce/jnn04-02b.htm]

Lovaas' ''Applied Behavioral Analysis'' (ABA) methods were the first scientifically validated therapy for autism. Early intervention, generally before school-age, is critical for children who would benefit from these programs.

== Aspects of autism ==

Some things to mention here:

* the ''[[autistic savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]] and research in the US suggesting a similar link between autism and [[DPT vaccine]].

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot;&amp;mdash;the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;&amp;mdash;see [[theory of mind]]

* Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]]'s influential research and his book ''Infantile Autism'' (1967) which argued that autism was not caused by childhood trauma or abuse, but by damage to certain areas of the brain, particularly the [[reticular formation]] which associates present sensory input with memories of past experiences. 

* recent claims, notably by Dr. Rimland, that autism is probably precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity [http://www.curezone.com/art/read.asp?ID=79&amp;db=2&amp;C0=735]

* increasingly common claims of successful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy. Dr. Rimland is a foremost proponent of this method.

* [[Relationship Development Intervention]] (RDI) is a treatment program targeting the core social/relationship deficits of autism

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life as a person with autism. [[Donna Williams]]  (''Autism: an inside-out approach'', ISBN 1-85302-387-6) and her many other books give an interesting perspective on the experience of the person with autism.  Dozens of other autistic people have also written books on autism and other topics.

== Controversies in Autism ==

Controversy exists as to whether autism, particularly (but by no means limited to) Asperger autism, is a disorder at all, or simply a variation in neurological hardwiring. Many autistics do not lack language skills (some mute autistics such as Jasmine O'Neill write very well) and desire to speak for themselves about their experience. They do not desire a cure, but rather to be given opportunities to use their unique skills and perceptions in useful ways. Websites such as [http://www.autistics.org autistics.org] present their view. 

Some people understand this attitude as an outgrowth of their perception that the word &quot;autism&quot; is fast becoming misused to define shy, intellectually-oriented children who are not extroverted nor interested in sports, or who are slightly developmentally delayed (better autistic than retarded?).  However, the original autistic people to popularize the view that autistic people need not be cured, of whom one of the most famous is Jim Sinclair, were diagnosed in a time when autism was a decidedly unpopular diagnosis.  Thus, it should also not lightly be assumed that autistic people presenting this point of view represent a misdiagnosed group.  Many have been diagnosed correctly, are not simply shy or introverted geeks with a few social quirks, experience severe problems in day to day functioning, but find that autism is still too much of an intrinsic part of themselves to want to have it indiscriminately eradicated in the name of normalcy.   Parents who are desperate for a &quot;normal&quot; child may agree to all sorts of treatments, including electroshock therapy, neuroleptic and antidepressant medication, and behavioristic training -- which at its most extreme appears barbaric, to say the least.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in approximately 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and is 4 times more prevalent in males than females (source: The Autism Society of America [http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer]).  It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

[[As of 2004]], autism is treatable, but not curable (although there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

== Severity of symptoms == 

Autism presents in a wide degree of severity, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remediated enough to appear unexceptional to acquaintances.

== &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High-functioning&quot; ==

In terms of both classification and [[therapy]], autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 referred to as having &quot;low-functioning autism&quot; (LFA), while those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high functioning autism&quot; (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living, rather than to IQ.  

This discrepancy can lead to confusion among service providers who equate IQ with functioning and may refuse to serve high-IQ autistic people who are severely compromised in their ability to perform daily living tasks, or may fail to recognize the intellectual potential of many autistic people who are considered LFA.

== Asperger's and Kanner's syndrome ==

Of the most common presentations of autism, [[Kanner's syndrome]] is often described as classical autism, implying low-functioning, while [[Asperger's syndrome]] is described as a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case.

In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) the most significant difference between [[Autistic Disorder]] (Kanner's) and Asperger's Disorder is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm] while in these areas a diagnosis of Asperger's observes &quot;no clinically significant delay.&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm]

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with Autistic Disorder has fed the popular conception that ''Asperger's Syndrome'' is synonymous with HFA, or that it is a lesser disorder than ''autism''.  There is also a popular but untrue conception that autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning are automatically ''Asperger's Syndrome'', or that both are merely geeks with a medical label attached.

Autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately presented in [[Rain Man]] is an encouragement for relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as suffering from Asperger's rather than autism.

== Autism as a spectrum disorder ==

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have had some form of autism.  Autistic people may have other [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] such as dyslexia. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.  There are also cases of children developing abnormally from birth but regressing around the age of 18 months, causing some degree of controversy as to when the neurological difference involved in autism truly began.

== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%.

In [[2001]], [[Wired Magazine]] published an interesting speculative article [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers_pr.html The Geek Syndrome] exploring the surge in apparent autism in [[Silicon Valley]]. This is only one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior. Shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism.

== Remediation of autistic behaviors ==

Remediation of debilitating aspects of autism was long hindered not only by widespread disagreement over its nature and causes, but by lack of a recognized and effective course of therapy.

Dr. [[Bruno Bettelheim]] believed that autism was linked to trauma in early childhood, and his work was highly influential for decades.  Parents, and especially mothers, of autistics were blamed for having caused their child's condition through the withholding of affection. [[Leo Kanner]], who first described autism (''Autistic disturbances of affective contact'', 1943) originated the concept of &quot;refrigerator mothers&quot; in regard to autism, although he eventually renounced the concept.  Bettelheim took the theory further. These theories did nothing to address the fact that having more than one autistic child in a family is exceptional, not the rule.  Treatments based on these theories failed to help autistic children.

A major breakthrough in the remediation of autistic behaviors came through work spearheaded by [[Ole Ivar Lovaas]], who believed that success could be obtained by behavioral approaches.
:''Lovaas' approaches&amp;mdash;often referred to as Discrete Trial, Intensive Behavior Intervention, and Applied Behavior Analysis&amp;mdash;are some of the best known and most widely used in the field and focus on the development of attention, imitation, receptive or expressive language, and pre-academic and self-help skills. Using a one-to-one therapist-child ratio and the “antecedent-behavior-consequence” (ABC) model, interventions based on this work involve trials or tasks. Each consists of (a) an antecedent, which is a directive or request for the child to perform an action; (b) a behavior, or response from the child, which may be categorized as successful performance, noncompliance, or no response; and (c) a consequence, defined as the reaction from the therapist, which ranges from strong positive reinforcement to a strong negative response, “No!”''(Autism Society of America, 2001).[http://www.aann.org/ce/jnn04-02b.htm]

Lovaas' ''Applied Behavioral Analysis'' (ABA) methods were the first scientifically validated therapy for autism. Early intervention, generally before school-age, is critical for children who would benefit from these programs.

== Aspects of autism ==

Some things to mention here:

* the ''[[autistic savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]] and research in the US suggesting a similar link between autism and [[DPT vaccine]].

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot;&amp;mdash;the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;&amp;mdash;see [[theory of mind]]

* Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]]'s influential research and his book ''Infantile Autism'' (1967) which argued that autism was not caused by childhood trauma or abuse, but by damage to certain areas of the brain, particularly the [[reticular formation]] which associates present sensory input with memories of past experiences. Dr. Rimland is a foremost advocate of the theory that autism may be precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity.[http://www.curezone.com/art/read.asp?ID=79&amp;db=2&amp;C0=735] He also is prominent in increasingly common claims of successful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy.

* [[Relationship Development Intervention]] (RDI) is a [[proprietary]] treatment program targeting the core social/relationship deficits of autism

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life as a person with autism. [[Donna Williams]]  (''Autism: an inside-out approach'', ISBN 1-85302-387-6) and her many other books give an interesting perspective on the experience of the person with autism.  Dozens of other autistic people have also written books on autism and other topics.

== Controversies in Autism ==

Controversy exists as to whether autism, particularly (but by no means limited to) Asperger autism, is a disorder at all, or simply a variation in neurological hardwiring. Many autistics do not lack language skills (some mute autistics such as Jasmine O'Neill write very well) and desire to speak for themselves about their experience. They do not desire a cure, but rather to be given opportunities to use their unique skills and perceptions in useful ways. Websites such as [http://www.autistics.org autistics.org] present their view. 

Some people understand this attitude as an outgrowth of their perception that the word &quot;autism&quot; is fast becoming misused to define shy, intellectually-oriented children who are not extroverted nor interested in sports, or who are slightly developmentally delayed (better autistic than retarded?).  However, the original autistic people to popularize the view that autistic people need not be cured, of whom one of the most famous is Jim Sinclair, were diagnosed in a time when autism was a decidedly unpopular diagnosis.  Thus, it should also not lightly be assumed that autistic people presenting this point of view represent a misdiagnosed group.  Many have been diagnosed correctly, are not simply shy or introverted geeks with a few social quirks, experience severe problems in day to day functioning, but find that autism is still too much of an intrinsic part of themselves to want to have it indiscriminately eradicated in the name of normalcy.   Parents who are desperate for a &quot;normal&quot; child may agree to all sorts of treatments, including electroshock therapy, neuroleptic and antidepressant medication, and behavioristic training -- which at its most extreme appears barbaric, to say the least.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in approximately 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and is 4 times more prevalent in males than females (source: The Autism Society of America [http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer]).  It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

[[As of 2004]], autism is treatable, but not curable (although there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

== Severity of symptoms == 

Autism presents in a wide degree of severity, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remediated enough to appear unexceptional to acquaintances.

== &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High-functioning&quot; ==

In terms of both classification and [[therapy]], autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 referred to as having &quot;low-functioning autism&quot; (LFA), while those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high functioning autism&quot; (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living, rather than to IQ.  

This discrepancy can lead to confusion among service providers who equate IQ with functioning and may refuse to serve high-IQ autistic people who are severely compromised in their ability to perform daily living tasks, or may fail to recognize the intellectual potential of many autistic people who are considered LFA.

== Asperger's and Kanner's syndrome ==

Of the most common presentations of autism, [[Kanner's syndrome]] is often described as classical autism, implying low-functioning, while [[Asperger's syndrome]] is described as a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case.

In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) the most significant difference between [[Autistic Disorder]] (Kanner's) and Asperger's Disorder is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm] while in these areas a diagnosis of Asperger's observes &quot;no clinically significant delay.&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm]

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with Autistic Disorder has fed the popular conception that ''Asperger's Syndrome'' is synonymous with HFA, or that it is a lesser disorder than ''autism''.  There is also a popular but untrue conception that autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning are automatically ''Asperger's Syndrome'', or that both are merely geeks with a medical label attached.

Autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately presented in [[Rain Man]] is an encouragement for relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as suffering from Asperger's rather than autism.

== Autism as a spectrum disorder ==

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have had some form of autism.  Autistic people may have other [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] such as dyslexia. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.  There are also cases of children developing abnormally from birth but regressing around the age of 18 months, causing some degree of controversy as to when the neurological difference involved in autism truly began.

== Rare Autism spectrum disorders ==
=== Rett Syndrome ===

Rett syndrome is relatively rare, affecting almost exclusively females, one out of 10,000 to 15,000. After a period of normal development, sometime between 6 and 18 months, autism-like symptoms begin to appear. The little girl's mental and social development regresses—she no longer responds to her parents and pulls away from any social contact. If she has been talking, she stops; she cannot control her feet; she wrings her hands. Some of the problems associated with Rett syndrome can be treated. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy can help with problems of coordination, movement, and speech.

Scientists sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have discovered that a mutation in the sequence of a single gene can cause Rett syndrome. This discovery may help doctors slow or stop the progress of the syndrome. It may also lead to methods of screening for Rett syndrome, thus enabling doctors to start treating these children much sooner, and improving the quality of life these children experience.*

===Childhood Disintegrative Disorder===

Very few children who have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis meet the criteria for childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD). An estimate based on four surveys of ASD found fewer than two children per 100,000 with ASD could be classified as having CDD. This suggests that CDD is a very rare form of ASD. It has a strong male preponderance.** Symptoms may appear by age 2, but the average age of onset is between 3 and 4 years. Until this time, the child has age-appropriate skills in communication and social relationships. The long period of normal development before regression helps differentiate CDD from Rett syndrome. 
== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%.

In [[2001]], [[Wired Magazine]] published an interesting speculative article [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers_pr.html The Geek Syndrome] exploring the surge in apparent autism in [[Silicon Valley]]. This is only one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior. Shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism.

== Remediation of autistic behaviors ==

Remediation of debilitating aspects of autism was long hindered not only by widespread disagreement over its nature and causes, but by lack of a recognized and effective course of therapy.

Dr. [[Bruno Bettelheim]] believed that autism was linked to trauma in early childhood, and his work was highly influential for decades.  Parents, and especially mothers, of autistics were blamed for having caused their child's condition through the withholding of affection. [[Leo Kanner]], who first described autism (''Autistic disturbances of affective contact'', 1943) originated the concept of &quot;refrigerator mothers&quot; in regard to autism, although he eventually renounced the concept.  Bettelheim took the theory further. These theories did nothing to address the fact that having more than one autistic child in a family is exceptional, not the rule.  Treatments based on these theories failed to help autistic children.

A major breakthrough in the remediation of autistic behaviors came through work spearheaded by [[Ole Ivar Lovaas]], who believed that success could be obtained by behavioral approaches.
:''Lovaas' approaches&amp;mdash;often referred to as Discrete Trial, Intensive Behavior Intervention, and Applied Behavior Analysis&amp;mdash;are some of the best known and most widely used in the field and focus on the development of attention, imitation, receptive or expressive language, and pre-academic and self-help skills. Using a one-to-one therapist-child ratio and the &amp;#8220;antecedent-behavior-consequence&amp;#8221; (ABC) model, interventions based on this work involve trials or tasks. Each consists of (a) an antecedent, which is a directive or request for the child to perform an action; (b) a behavior, or response from the child, which may be categorized as successful performance, noncompliance, or no response; and (c) a consequence, defined as the reaction from the therapist, which ranges from strong positive reinforcement to a strong negative response, &amp;#8220;No!&amp;#8221;''(Autism Society of America, 2001).[http://www.aann.org/ce/jnn04-02b.htm] 

Lovaas' ''Applied Behavioral Analysis'' (ABA) methods were the first scientifically validated therapy for autism. Early intervention, generally before school-age, is critical for children who would benefit from these programs. ABA is not for all autistic or developmentally delayed children and [http://users.1st.net/cibra/OpenLetter.htm may be seriously traumatic], causing further regression instead of progress. Before signing your child up for an ABA program, be sure you know exactly [http://users.1st.net/cibra/warningindex.htm what will be done to your child and why]. 

== Aspects of autism ==

Some things to mention here:

* the ''[[autistic savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]] and research in the US suggesting a similar link between autism and [[DPT vaccine]].

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot;&amp;mdash;the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;&amp;mdash;see [[theory of mind]]

* Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]]'s influential research and his book ''Infantile Autism'' (1967) which argued that autism was not caused by childhood trauma or abuse, but by damage to certain areas of the brain, particularly the [[reticular formation]] which associates present sensory input with memories of past experiences. Dr. Rimland is a foremost advocate of the theory that autism may be precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity.[http://www.curezone.com/art/read.asp?ID=79&amp;db=2&amp;C0=735] He also is prominent in increasingly common claims of successful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy.

* [[Relationship Development Intervention]] (RDI) is a [[proprietary]] treatment program targeting the core social/relationship deficits of autism

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life as a person with autism. [[Donna Williams]]  (''Autism: an inside-out approach'', ISBN 1-85302-387-6) and her many other books give an interesting perspective on the experience of the person with autism.  Dozens of other autistic people have also written books on autism and other topics.

== Controversies in Autism ==

Controversy exists as to whether autism, particularly (but by no means limited to) Asperger autism, is a disorder at all, or simply a variation in neurological hardwiring. Many autistics do not lack language skills (some mute autistics such as Jasmine O'Neill write very well) and desire to speak for themselves about their experience. They do not desire a cure, but rather to be given opportunities to use their unique skills and perceptions in useful ways. Websites such as [http://www.autistics.org autistics.org] present their view. 

Some people understand this attitude as an outgrowth of their perception that the word &quot;autism&quot; is fast becoming misused to define shy, intellectually-oriented children who are not extroverted nor interested in sports, or who are slightly developmentally delayed (better autistic than retarded?).  However, the original autistic people to popularize the view that autistic people need not be cured, of whom one of the most famous is Jim Sinclair, were diagnosed in a time when autism was a decidedly unpopular diagnosis.  Thus, it should also not lightly be assumed that autistic people presenting this point of view represent a misdiagnosed group.  Many have been diagnosed correctly, are not simply shy or introverted geeks with a few social quirks, experience severe problems in day to day functioning, but find that autism is still too much of an intrinsic part of themselves to want to have it indiscriminately eradicated in the name of normalcy.   Parents who are desperate for a &quot;normal&quot; child may agree to all sorts of treatments, including electroshock therapy, neuroleptic and antidepressant medication, and ABA behavioristic training -- which at its most extreme appears barbaric, to say the least.

Very few children who have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis meet the criteria for childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in approximately 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and is 4 times more prevalent in males than females (source: The Autism Society of America [http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer]).  It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

[[As of 2004]], autism is treatable, but not curable (although there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

== Severity of symptoms == 

Autism presents in a wide degree of severity, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remediated enough to appear unexceptional to acquaintances.

== &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High-functioning&quot; ==

In terms of both classification and [[therapy]], autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 referred to as having &quot;low-functioning autism&quot; (LFA), while those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high functioning autism&quot; (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living, rather than to IQ.  

This discrepancy can lead to confusion among service providers who equate IQ with functioning and may refuse to serve high-IQ autistic people who are severely compromised in their ability to perform daily living tasks, or may fail to recognize the intellectual potential of many autistic people who are considered LFA.

== Asperger's and Kanner's syndrome ==

Of the most common presentations of autism, [[Kanner's syndrome]] is often described as classical autism, implying low-functioning, while [[Asperger's syndrome]] is described as a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case.

In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) the most significant difference between [[Autistic Disorder]] (Kanner's) and Asperger's Disorder is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm] while in these areas a diagnosis of Asperger's observes &quot;no clinically significant delay.&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm]

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with Autistic Disorder has fed the popular conception that ''Asperger's Syndrome'' is synonymous with HFA, or that it is a lesser disorder than ''autism''.  There is also a popular but untrue conception that autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning are automatically ''Asperger's Syndrome'', or that both are merely geeks with a medical label attached.

Autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately presented in [[Rain Man]] is an encouragement for relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as suffering from Asperger's rather than autism.

== Autism as a spectrum disorder ==

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have had some form of autism.  Autistic people may have other [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] such as dyslexia. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.  There are also cases of children developing abnormally from birth but regressing around the age of 18 months, causing some degree of controversy as to when the neurological difference involved in autism truly began.

== Rare Autism spectrum disorders ==
=== Rett Syndrome ===

Rett syndrome is relatively rare, affecting almost exclusively females, one out of 10,000 to 15,000. After a period of normal development, sometime between 6 and 18 months, autism-like symptoms begin to appear. The little girl's mental and social development regresses—she no longer responds to her parents and pulls away from any social contact. If she has been talking, she stops; she cannot control her feet; she wrings her hands. Some of the problems associated with Rett syndrome can be treated. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy can help with problems of coordination, movement, and speech.

Scientists sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have discovered that a mutation in the sequence of a single gene can cause Rett syndrome. This discovery may help doctors slow or stop the progress of the syndrome. It may also lead to methods of screening for Rett syndrome, thus enabling doctors to start treating these children much sooner, and improving the quality of life these children experience.*

===Childhood Disintegrative Disorder===

Very few children who have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis meet the criteria for childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD). An estimate based on four surveys of ASD found fewer than two children per 100,000 with ASD could be classified as having CDD. This suggests that CDD is a very rare form of ASD. It has a strong male preponderance.** Symptoms may appear by age 2, but the average age of onset is between 3 and 4 years. Until this time, the child has age-appropriate skills in communication and social relationships. The long period of normal development before regression helps differentiate CDD from Rett syndrome.

&lt;/small&gt;

== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%.

In [[2001]], [[Wired Magazine]] published an interesting speculative article [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers_pr.html The Geek Syndrome] exploring the surge in apparent autism in [[Silicon Valley]]. This is only one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior. Shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism.

== Remediation of autistic behaviors ==

Remediation of debilitating aspects of autism was long hindered not only by widespread disagreement over its nature and causes, but by lack of a recognized and effective course of therapy.

Dr. [[Bruno Bettelheim]] believed that autism was linked to trauma in early childhood, and his work was highly influential for decades.  Parents, and especially mothers, of autistics were blamed for having caused their child's condition through the withholding of affection. [[Leo Kanner]], who first described autism (''Autistic disturbances of affective contact'', 1943) originated the concept of &quot;refrigerator mothers&quot; in regard to autism, although he eventually renounced the concept.  Bettelheim took the theory further. These theories did nothing to address the fact that having more than one autistic child in a family is exceptional, not the rule.  Treatments based on these theories failed to help autistic children.

A major breakthrough in the remediation of autistic behaviors came through work spearheaded by [[Ole Ivar Lovaas]], who believed that success could be obtained by behavioral approaches.
:''Lovaas' approaches&amp;mdash;often referred to as Discrete Trial, Intensive Behavior Intervention, and Applied Behavior Analysis&amp;mdash;are some of the best known and most widely used in the field and focus on the development of attention, imitation, receptive or expressive language, and pre-academic and self-help skills. Using a one-to-one therapist-child ratio and the &amp;#8220;antecedent-behavior-consequence&amp;#8221; (ABC) model, interventions based on this work involve trials or tasks. Each consists of (a) an antecedent, which is a directive or request for the child to perform an action; (b) a behavior, or response from the child, which may be categorized as successful performance, noncompliance, or no response; and (c) a consequence, defined as the reaction from the therapist, which ranges from strong positive reinforcement to a strong negative response, &amp;#8220;No!&amp;#8221;''(Autism Society of America, 2001).[http://www.aann.org/ce/jnn04-02b.htm] 

Lovaas' ''Applied Behavioral Analysis'' (ABA) methods were the first scientifically validated therapy for autism. Early intervention, generally before school-age, is critical for children who would benefit from these programs. ABA is not for all autistic or developmentally delayed children and [http://users.1st.net/cibra/OpenLetter.htm may be seriously traumatic], causing further regression instead of progress. Before signing your child up for an ABA program, be sure you know exactly [http://users.1st.net/cibra/warningindex.htm what will be done to your child and why]. 

== Aspects of autism ==

Some things to mention here:

* the ''[[autistic savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]] and research in the US suggesting a similar link between autism and [[DPT vaccine]].

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot;&amp;mdash;the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;&amp;mdash;see [[theory of mind]]

* Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]]'s influential research and his book ''Infantile Autism'' (1967) which argued that autism was not caused by childhood trauma or abuse, but by damage to certain areas of the brain, particularly the [[reticular formation]] which associates present sensory input with memories of past experiences. Dr. Rimland is a foremost advocate of the theory that autism may be precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity.[http://www.curezone.com/art/read.asp?ID=79&amp;db=2&amp;C0=735] He also is prominent in increasingly common claims of successful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy.

* [[Relationship Development Intervention]] (RDI) is a [[proprietary]] treatment program targeting the core social/relationship deficits of autism

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life as a person with autism. [[Donna Williams]]  (''Autism: an inside-out approach'', ISBN 1-85302-387-6) and her many other books give an interesting perspective on the experience of the person with autism.  Dozens of other autistic people have also written books on autism and other topics.

== Controversies in Autism ==

Controversy exists as to whether autism, particularly (but by no means limited to) Asperger autism, is a disorder at all, or simply a variation in neurological hardwiring. Many autistics do not lack language skills (some mute autistics such as Jasmine O'Neill write very well) and desire to speak for themselves about their experience. They do not desire a cure, but rather to be given opportunities to use their unique skills and perceptions in useful ways. Websites such as [http://www.autistics.org autistics.org] present their view. 

Some people understand this attitude as an outgrowth of their perception that the word &quot;autism&quot; is fast becoming misused to define shy, intellectually-oriented children who are not extroverted nor interested in sports, or who are slightly developmentally delayed (better autistic than retarded?).  However, the original autistic people to popularize the view that autistic people need not be cured, of whom one of the most famous is Jim Sinclair, were diagnosed in a time when autism was a decidedly unpopular diagnosis.  Thus, it should also not lightly be assumed that autistic people presenting this point of view represent a misdiagnosed group.  Many have been diagnosed correctly, are not simply shy or introverted geeks with a few social quirks, experience severe problems in day to day functioning, but find that autism is still too much of an intrinsic part of themselves to want to have it indiscriminately eradicated in the name of normalcy.   Parents who are desperate for a &quot;normal&quot; child may agree to all sorts of treatments, including electroshock therapy, neuroleptic and antidepressant medication, and ABA behavioristic training -- which at its most extreme appears barbaric, to say the least.

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life as a person with autism. [[Donna Williams]]  (''Autism: an inside-out approach'', ISBN 1-85302-387-6) and her many other books give an interesting perspective on the experience of the person with autism.  Dozens of other autistic people have also written books on autism and other topics.

== Controversies in Autism ==

Controversy exists as to whether autism, particularly (but by no means limited to) Asperger autism, is a disorder at all, or simply a variation in neurological hardwiring. Many autistics do not lack language skills (some mute autistics such as Jasmine O'Neill write very well) and desire to speak for themselves about their experience. They do not desire a cure, but rather to be given opportunities to use their unique skills and perceptions in useful ways. Websites such as [http://www.autistics.org autistics.org] present their view. 

Some people understand this attitude as an outgrowth of their perception that the word &quot;autism&quot; is fast becoming misused to define shy, intellectually-oriented children who are not extroverted nor interested in sports, or who are slightly developmentally delayed (better autistic than retarded?).  However, the original autistic people to popularize the view that autistic people need not be cured, of whom one of the most famous is Jim Sinclair, were diagnosed in a time when autism was a decidedly unpopular diagnosis.  Thus, it should also not lightly be assumed that autistic people presenting this point of view represent a misdiagnosed group.  Many have been diagnosed correctly, are not simply shy or introverted geeks with a few social quirks, experience severe problems in day to day functioning, but find that autism is still too much of an intrinsic part of themselves to want to have it indiscriminately eradicated in the name of normalcy.   Parents who are desperate for a &quot;normal&quot; child may agree to all sorts of treatments, including electroshock therapy, neuroleptic and antidepressant medication, and ABA behavioristic training -- which at its most extreme appears barbaric, to say the least.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in approximately 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and is 4 times more prevalent in males than females (source: The Autism Society of America [http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer]).  It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

[[As of 2004]], autism is treatable, but not curable (although there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

[[Image:Autismbrain.jpg|right|thumb|400px|]]
== Severity of symptoms == 

Autism presents in a wide degree of severity, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remediated enough to appear unexceptional to acquaintances.

== &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High-functioning&quot; ==

In terms of both classification and [[therapy]], autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 referred to as having &quot;low-functioning autism&quot; (LFA), while those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high functioning autism&quot; (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living, rather than to IQ.  

This discrepancy can lead to confusion among service providers who equate IQ with functioning and may refuse to serve high-IQ autistic people who are severely compromised in their ability to perform daily living tasks, or may fail to recognize the intellectual potential of many autistic people who are considered LFA.

== Asperger's and Kanner's syndrome ==

Of the most common presentations of autism, [[Kanner's syndrome]] is often described as classical autism, implying low-functioning, while [[Asperger's syndrome]] is described as a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case.

In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) the most significant difference between [[Autistic Disorder]] (Kanner's) and Asperger's Disorder is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm] while in these areas a diagnosis of Asperger's observes &quot;no clinically significant delay.&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm]

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with Autistic Disorder has fed the popular conception that ''Asperger's Syndrome'' is synonymous with HFA, or that it is a lesser disorder than ''autism''.  There is also a popular but untrue conception that autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning are automatically ''Asperger's Syndrome'', or that both are merely geeks with a medical label attached.

Autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately presented in [[Rain Man]] is an encouragement for relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as suffering from Asperger's rather than autism.

== Autism as a spectrum disorder ==

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have had some form of autism.  Autistic people may have other [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] such as dyslexia. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.  There are also cases of children developing abnormally from birth but regressing around the age of 18 months, causing some degree of controversy as to when the neurological difference involved in autism truly began.

== Rare Autism spectrum disorders ==
=== Rett Syndrome ===

Rett syndrome is relatively rare, affecting almost exclusively females, one out of 10,000 to 15,000. After a period of normal development, sometime between 6 and 18 months, autism-like symptoms begin to appear. The little girl's mental and social development regresses—she no longer responds to her parents and pulls away from any social contact. If she has been talking, she stops; she cannot control her feet; she wrings her hands. Some of the problems associated with Rett syndrome can be treated. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy can help with problems of coordination, movement, and speech.

Scientists sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have discovered that a mutation in the sequence of a single gene can cause Rett syndrome. This discovery may help doctors slow or stop the progress of the syndrome. It may also lead to methods of screening for Rett syndrome, thus enabling doctors to start treating these children much sooner, and improving the quality of life these children experience.*

===Childhood Disintegrative Disorder===

Very few children who have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis meet the criteria for childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD). An estimate based on four surveys of ASD found fewer than two children per 100,000 with ASD could be classified as having CDD. This suggests that CDD is a very rare form of ASD. It has a strong male preponderance.** Symptoms may appear by age 2, but the average age of onset is between 3 and 4 years. Until this time, the child has age-appropriate skills in communication and social relationships. The long period of normal development before regression helps differentiate CDD from Rett syndrome.

== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%.

In [[2001]], [[Wired Magazine]] published an interesting speculative article [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers_pr.html The Geek Syndrome] exploring the surge in apparent autism in [[Silicon Valley]]. This is only one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior. Shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism.

== Remediation of autistic behaviors ==

Remediation of debilitating aspects of autism was long hindered not only by widespread disagreement over its nature and causes, but by lack of a recognized and effective course of therapy.

Dr. [[Bruno Bettelheim]] believed that autism was linked to trauma in early childhood, and his work was highly influential for decades.  Parents, and especially mothers, of autistics were blamed for having caused their child's condition through the withholding of affection. [[Leo Kanner]], who first described autism (''Autistic disturbances of affective contact'', 1943) originated the concept of &quot;refrigerator mothers&quot; in regard to autism, although he eventually renounced the concept.  Bettelheim took the theory further. These theories did nothing to address the fact that having more than one autistic child in a family is exceptional, not the rule.  Treatments based on these theories failed to help autistic children.

A major breakthrough in the remediation of autistic behaviors came through work spearheaded by [[Ole Ivar Lovaas]], who believed that success could be obtained by behavioral approaches.
:''Lovaas' approaches&amp;mdash;often referred to as Discrete Trial, Intensive Behavior Intervention, and Applied Behavior Analysis&amp;mdash;are some of the best known and most widely used in the field and focus on the development of attention, imitation, receptive or expressive language, and pre-academic and self-help skills. Using a one-to-one therapist-child ratio and the &amp;#8220;antecedent-behavior-consequence&amp;#8221; (ABC) model, interventions based on this work involve trials or tasks. Each consists of (a) an antecedent, which is a directive or request for the child to perform an action; (b) a behavior, or response from the child, which may be categorized as successful performance, noncompliance, or no response; and (c) a consequence, defined as the reaction from the therapist, which ranges from strong positive reinforcement to a strong negative response, &amp;#8220;No!&amp;#8221;''(Autism Society of America, 2001).[http://www.aann.org/ce/jnn04-02b.htm] 

Lovaas' ''Applied Behavioral Analysis'' (ABA) methods were the first scientifically validated therapy for autism. Early intervention, generally before school-age, is critical for children who would benefit from these programs. ABA is not for all autistic or developmentally delayed children and [http://users.1st.net/cibra/OpenLetter.htm may be seriously traumatic], causing further regression instead of progress. Before signing your child up for an ABA program, be sure you know exactly [http://users.1st.net/cibra/warningindex.htm what will be done to your child and why]. 

== Aspects of autism ==

Some things to mention here:

* the ''[[autistic savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]] and research in the US suggesting a similar link between autism and [[DPT vaccine]].

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot;&amp;mdash;the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;&amp;mdash;see [[theory of mind]]

* Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]]'s influential research and his book ''Infantile Autism'' (1967) which argued that autism was not caused by childhood trauma or abuse, but by damage to certain areas of the brain, particularly the [[reticular formation]] which associates present sensory input with memories of past experiences. Dr. Rimland is a foremost advocate of the theory that autism may be precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity.[http://www.curezone.com/art/read.asp?ID=79&amp;db=2&amp;C0=735] He also is prominent in increasingly common claims of successful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy.

* [[Relationship Development Intervention]] (RDI) is a [[proprietary]] treatment program targeting the core social/relationship deficits of autism

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life as a person with autism. [[Donna Williams]]  (''Autism: an inside-out approach'', ISBN 1-85302-387-6) and her many other books give an interesting perspective on the experience of the person with autism.

==Adults with an Autism Spectrum Disorder==

Some adults with ASD, especially those with high-functioning autism or with Asperger syndrome, are able to work successfully in mainstream jobs. Nevertheless, communication and social problems often cause difficulties in many areas of life. They will continue to need encouragement and moral support in their struggle for an independent life.

Many others with ASD are capable of employment in sheltered workshops under the supervision of managers trained in working with persons with disabilities. A nurturing environment at home, at school, and later in job training and at work, helps persons with ASD continue to learn and to develop throughout their lives.

In the United States, the public schools' responsibility for providing services ends when the person with ASD reaches the age of 22. The family is then faced with the challenge of finding living arrangements and employment to match the particular needs of their adult child, as well as the programs and facilities that can provide support services to achieve these goals. Long before your child finishes school, you will want to search for the best programs and facilities for your young adult. If you know other parents of ASD adults, ask them about the services available in your community. If your community has little to offer, serve as an advocate for your child and work toward the goal of improved employment services. Research the resources listed in the back of this brochure to learn as much as possible about the help your child is eligible to receive as an adult.

== Severity of symptoms == 

Autism presents in a wide degree of severity, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remediated enough to appear unexceptional to acquaintances.

== &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High-functioning&quot; ==

In terms of both classification and [[therapy]], autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 referred to as having &quot;low-functioning autism&quot; (LFA), while those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high functioning autism&quot; (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living, rather than to IQ.  

This discrepancy can lead to confusion among service providers who equate IQ with functioning and may refuse to serve high-IQ autistic people who are severely compromised in their ability to perform daily living tasks, or may fail to recognize the intellectual potential of many autistic people who are considered LFA.

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with Autistic Disorder has fed the popular conception that ''Asperger's Syndrome'' is synonymous with HFA, or that it is a lesser disorder than ''autism''.  There is also a popular but untrue conception that autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning are automatically ''Asperger's Syndrome'', or that both are merely geeks with a medical label attached.

Very few children who have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis meet the criteria for childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD). An estimate based on four surveys of ASD found fewer than two children per 100,000 with ASD could be classified as having CDD. This suggests that CDD is a very rare form of ASD. It has a strong male preponderance.** Symptoms may appear by age 2, but the average age of onset is between 3 and 4 years. Until this time, the child has age-appropriate skills in communication and social relationships. The long period of normal development before regression helps differentiate CDD from Rett syndrome.

== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%.

In [[2001]], [[Wired Magazine]] published an interesting speculative article [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers_pr.html The Geek Syndrome] exploring the surge in apparent autism in [[Silicon Valley]]. This is only one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior. Shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism.

== Remediation of autistic behaviors ==

Remediation of debilitating aspects of autism was long hindered not only by widespread disagreement over its nature and causes, but by lack of a recognized and effective course of therapy.

Dr. [[Bruno Bettelheim]] believed that autism was linked to trauma in early childhood, and his work was highly influential for decades.  Parents, and especially mothers, of autistics were blamed for having caused their child's condition through the withholding of affection. [[Leo Kanner]], who first described autism (''Autistic disturbances of affective contact'', 1943) originated the concept of &quot;refrigerator mothers&quot; in regard to autism, although he eventually renounced the concept.  Bettelheim took the theory further. These theories did nothing to address the fact that having more than one autistic child in a family is exceptional, not the rule.  Treatments based on these theories failed to help autistic children.

A major breakthrough in the remediation of autistic behaviors came through work spearheaded by [[Ole Ivar Lovaas]], who believed that success could be obtained by behavioral approaches.
:''Lovaas' approaches&amp;mdash;often referred to as Discrete Trial, Intensive Behavior Intervention, and Applied Behavior Analysis&amp;mdash;are some of the best known and most widely used in the field and focus on the development of attention, imitation, receptive or expressive language, and pre-academic and self-help skills. Using a one-to-one therapist-child ratio and the &amp;#8220;antecedent-behavior-consequence&amp;#8221; (ABC) model, interventions based on this work involve trials or tasks. Each consists of (a) an antecedent, which is a directive or request for the child to perform an action; (b) a behavior, or response from the child, which may be categorized as successful performance, noncompliance, or no response; and (c) a consequence, defined as the reaction from the therapist, which ranges from strong positive reinforcement to a strong negative response, &amp;#8220;No!&amp;#8221;''(Autism Society of America, 2001).[http://www.aann.org/ce/jnn04-02b.htm] 

Lovaas' ''Applied Behavioral Analysis'' (ABA) methods were the first scientifically validated therapy for autism. Early intervention, generally before school-age, is critical for children who would benefit from these programs. ABA is not for all autistic or developmentally delayed children and [http://users.1st.net/cibra/OpenLetter.htm may be seriously traumatic], causing further regression instead of progress. Before signing your child up for an ABA program, be sure you know exactly [http://users.1st.net/cibra/warningindex.htm what will be done to your child and why]. 

== Aspects of autism ==

Some things to mention here:

* the ''[[autistic savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]] and research in the US suggesting a similar link between autism and [[DPT vaccine]].

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot;&amp;mdash;the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;&amp;mdash;see [[theory of mind]]

* Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]]'s influential research and his book ''Infantile Autism'' (1967) which argued that autism was not caused by childhood trauma or abuse, but by damage to certain areas of the brain, particularly the [[reticular formation]] which associates present sensory input with memories of past experiences. Dr. Rimland is a foremost advocate of the theory that autism may be precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity.[http://www.curezone.com/art/read.asp?ID=79&amp;db=2&amp;C0=735] He also is prominent in increasingly common claims of successful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy.

* [[Relationship Development Intervention]] (RDI) is a [[proprietary]] treatment program targeting the core social/relationship deficits of autism

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life as a person with autism. [[Donna Williams]]  (''Autism: an inside-out approach'', ISBN 1-85302-387-6) and her many other books give an interesting perspective on the experience of the person with autism.  Dozens of other autistic people have also written books on autism and other topics.

== Controversies in Autism ==

Controversy exists as to whether autism, particularly (but by no means limited to) Asperger autism, is a disorder at all, or simply a variation in neurological hardwiring. Many autistics do not lack language skills (some mute autistics such as Jasmine O'Neill write very well) and desire to speak for themselves about their experience. They do not desire a cure, but rather to be given opportunities to use their unique skills and perceptions in useful ways. Websites such as [http://www.autistics.org autistics.org] present their view. 

Some people understand this attitude as an outgrowth of their perception that the word &quot;autism&quot; is fast becoming misused to define shy, intellectually-oriented children who are not extroverted nor interested in sports, or who are slightly developmentally delayed (better autistic than retarded?).  However, the original autistic people to popularize the view that autistic people need not be cured, of whom one of the most famous is Jim Sinclair, were diagnosed in a time when autism was a decidedly unpopular diagnosis.  Thus, it should also not lightly be assumed that autistic people presenting this point of view represent a misdiagnosed group.  Many have been diagnosed correctly, are not simply shy or introverted geeks with a few social quirks, experience severe problems in day to day functioning, but find that autism is still too much of an intrinsic part of themselves to want to have it indiscriminately eradicated in the name of normalcy.   Parents who are desperate for a &quot;normal&quot; child may agree to all sorts of treatments, including electroshock therapy, neuroleptic and antidepressant medication, and ABA behavioristic training -- which at its most extreme appears barbaric, to say the least. [http://users.1st.net/cibra/index.htm Children Injured By Restraint and Aversives] presents open letters from parents on this subject.

==Adults with an Autism Spectrum Disorder==

Some adults with ASD, especially those with high-functioning autism or with Asperger syndrome, are able to work successfully in mainstream jobs. Nevertheless, communication and social problems often cause difficulties in many areas of life. 

Many others with ASD are capable of employment in sheltered workshops under the supervision of managers trained in working with persons with disabilities. A nurturing environment at home, at school, and later in job training and at work, helps persons with ASD continue to learn and to develop throughout their lives.

In the United States, the public schools' responsibility for providing services ends when the person with ASD reaches the age of 22. The family is then faced with the challenge of finding living arrangements and employment to match the particular needs of their adult child, as well as the programs and facilities that can provide support services to achieve these goals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in approximately 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and is 4 times more prevalent in males than females (source: The Autism Society of America [http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer]).  It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

[[As of 2004]], autism is treatable, but not curable (although there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

==Symptoms==
'''Possible Indicators of Autism Spectrum Disorders:'''
* Does not babble, point, or make meaningful gestures by 1 year of age
* Does not speak one word by 16 months
* Does not combine two words by 2 years
* Does not respond to name
* Loses language or social skills

'''Some Other Indicators:'''

* Poor eye contact
* Doesn't seem to know how to play with toys
* Excessively lines up toys or other objects
* Is attached to one particular toy or object
* Doesn't smile
* At times seems to be hearing impaired


===Social Symptoms===

From the start, typically developing infants are social beings. Early in life, they gaze at people, turn toward voices, grasp a finger, and even smile.

In contrast, most children with ASD seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. Even in the first few months of life, many do not interact and they avoid eye contact. They seem indifferent to other people, and often seem to prefer being alone. They may resist attention or passively accept hugs and cuddling. Later, they seldom seek comfort or respond to parents' displays of anger or affection in a typical way. Research has suggested that although children with ASD are attached to their parents, their expression of this attachment is unusual and difficult to &quot;read.&quot; To parents, it may seem as if their child is not attached at all Parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling, teaching, and playing with their child may feel crushed by this lack of the expected and typical attachment behavior.

Children with ASD also are slower in learning to interpret what others are thinking and feeling. Subtle social cues—whether a smile, a wink, or a grimace—may have little meaning. To a child who misses these cues, &quot;Come here&quot; always means the same thing, whether the speaker is smiling and extending her arms for a hug or frowning and planting her fists on her hips. Without the ability to interpret gestures and facial expressions, the social world may seem bewildering. To compound the problem, people with ASD have difficulty seeing things from another person's perspective. Most 5-year-olds understand that other people have different information, feelings, and goals than they have. A person with ASD may lack such understanding. This inability leaves them unable to predict or understand other people's actions.

Although not universal, it is common for people with ASD also to have difficulty regulating their emotions. This can take the form of &quot;immature&quot; behavior such as crying in class or verbal outbursts that seem inappropriate to those around them. The individual with ASD might also be disruptive and physically aggressive at times, making social relationships still more difficult. They have a tendency to &quot;lose control,&quot; particularly when they're in a strange or overwhelming environment, or when angry and frustrated. They may at times break things, attack others, or hurt themselves. In their frustration, some bang their heads, pull their hair, or bite their arms. 

==Communication Difficulties==

By age 3, most children have passed predictable milestones on the path to learning language; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when he hears his name, points when he wants a toy, and when offered something distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is &quot;no.&quot;

Some children diagnosed with ASD remain mute throughout their lives. Some infants who later show signs of ASD coo and babble during the first few months of life, but they soon stop. Others may be delayed, developing language as late as age 5 to 9. Some children may learn to use communication systems such as pictures or sign language.

Those who do speak often use language in unusual ways. They seem unable to combine words into meaningful sentences. Some speak only single words, while others repeat the same phrase over and over. Some ASD children parrot what they hear, a condition called echolalia. Although many children with no ASD go through a stage where they repeat what they hear, it normally passes by the time they are 3.

Some children only mildly affected may exhibit slight delays in language, or even seem to have precocious language and unusually large vocabularies, but have great difficulty in sustaining a conversation. The &quot;give and take&quot; of normal conversation is hard for them, although they often carry on a monologue on a favorite subject, giving no one else an opportunity to comment. Another difficulty is often the inability to understand body language, tone of voice, or &quot;phrases of speech.&quot; They might interpret a sarcastic expression such as &quot;Oh, that's just great&quot; as meaning it really IS great.

While it can be hard to understand what ASD children are saying, their body language is also difficult to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures rarely match what they are saying. Also, their tone of voice fails to reflect their feelings. A high-pitched, sing-song, or flat, robot-like voice is common. Some children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults, failing to pick up on the &quot;kid-speak&quot; that is common in their peers.

Without meaningful gestures or the language to ask for things, people with ASD are at a loss to let others know what they need. As a result, they may simply scream or grab what they want. Until they are taught better ways to express their needs, ASD children do whatever they can to get through to others. As people with ASD grow up, they can become increasingly aware of their difficulties in understanding others and in being understood. As a result they may become anxious or depressed.

===Repetitive Behaviors===

Although children with ASD usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, odd repetitive motions may set them off from other children. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or walking on their toes. Some suddenly freeze in position.

As children, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a certain way, rather than using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally moves one of the toys, the child may be tremendously upset. ASD children need, and demand, absolute consistency in their environment. A slight change in any routine—in mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, going to school at a certain time and by the same route—can be extremely disturbing. Perhaps order and sameness lend some stability in a world of confusion.

Repetitive behavior sometimes takes the form of a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all about vacuum cleaners, train schedules, or lighthouses. Often there is great interest in numbers, symbols, or science topics.

== Severity of symptoms == 

Autism presents in a wide degree of severity, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remediated enough to appear unexceptional to acquaintances.

== &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High-functioning&quot; ==

In terms of both classification and [[therapy]], autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 referred to as having &quot;low-functioning autism&quot; (LFA), while those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high functioning autism&quot; (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living, rather than to IQ.  

This discrepancy can lead to confusion among service providers who equate IQ with functioning and may refuse to serve high-IQ autistic people who are severely compromised in their ability to perform daily living tasks, or may fail to recognize the intellectual potential of many autistic people who are considered LFA.

== Asperger's and Kanner's syndrome ==

Of the most common presentations of autism, [[Kanner's syndrome]] is often described as classical autism, implying low-functioning, while [[Asperger's syndrome]] is described as a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case.

In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) the most significant difference between [[Autistic Disorder]] (Kanner's) and Asperger's Disorder is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm] while in these areas a diagnosis of Asperger's observes &quot;no clinically significant delay.&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm]

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with Autistic Disorder has fed the popular conception that ''Asperger's Syndrome'' is synonymous with HFA, or that it is a lesser disorder than ''autism''.  There is also a popular but untrue conception that autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning are automatically ''Asperger's Syndrome'', or that both are merely geeks with a medical label attached.

Autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately presented in [[Rain Man]] is an encouragement for relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as suffering from Asperger's rather than autism.

== Autism as a spectrum disorder ==

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have had some form of autism.  Autistic people may have other [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] such as dyslexia. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.  There are also cases of children developing abnormally from birth but regressing around the age of 18 months, causing some degree of controversy as to when the neurological difference involved in autism truly began.

== Rare Autism spectrum disorders ==
=== Rett Syndrome ===

Rett syndrome is relatively rare, affecting almost exclusively females, one out of 10,000 to 15,000. After a period of normal development, sometime between 6 and 18 months, autism-like symptoms begin to appear. The little girl's mental and social development regresses—she no longer responds to her parents and pulls away from any social contact. If she has been talking, she stops; she cannot control her feet; she wrings her hands. Some of the problems associated with Rett syndrome can be treated. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy can help with problems of coordination, movement, and speech.

Scientists sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have discovered that a mutation in the sequence of a single gene can cause Rett syndrome. This discovery may help doctors slow or stop the progress of the syndrome. It may also lead to methods of screening for Rett syndrome, thus enabling doctors to start treating these children much sooner, and improving the quality of life these children experience.*

===Childhood Disintegrative Disorder===

Very few children who have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis meet the criteria for childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD). An estimate based on four surveys of ASD found fewer than two children per 100,000 with ASD could be classified as having CDD. This suggests that CDD is a very rare form of ASD. It has a strong male preponderance.** Symptoms may appear by age 2, but the average age of onset is between 3 and 4 years. Until this time, the child has age-appropriate skills in communication and social relationships. The long period of normal development before regression helps differentiate CDD from Rett syndrome.

However, the original autistic people to popularize the view that autistic people need not be cured, of whom one of the most famous is Jim Sinclair, were diagnosed in a time when autism was a decidedly unpopular diagnosis.  Thus, it should also not lightly be assumed that autistic people presenting this point of view represent a misdiagnosed group.  Many have been diagnosed correctly, are not simply shy or introverted geeks with a few social quirks, experience severe problems in day to day functioning, but find that autism is still too much of an intrinsic part of themselves to want to have it indiscriminately eradicated in the name of normalcy.   Parents who are desperate for a &quot;normal&quot; child may agree to all sorts of treatments, including electroshock therapy, neuroleptic and antidepressant medication, and ABA behavioristic training -- which at its most extreme appears barbaric, to say the least.

==Adults with an Autism Spectrum Disorder==

Some adults with ASD, especially those with high-functioning autism or with Asperger syndrome, are able to work successfully in mainstream jobs. Nevertheless, communication and social problems often cause difficulties in many areas of life. 

Many others with ASD are capable of employment in sheltered workshops under the supervision of managers trained in working with persons with disabilities. A nurturing environment at home, at school, and later in job training and at work, helps persons with ASD continue to learn and to develop throughout their lives.

In the United States, the public schools' responsibility for providing services ends when the person with ASD reaches the age of 22. The family is then faced with the challenge of finding living arrangements and employment to match the particular needs of their adult child, as well as the programs and facilities that can provide support services to achieve these goals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in approximately 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and is 4 times more prevalent in males than females (source: The Autism Society of America [http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer]).  It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

[[As of 2004]], autism is treatable, but not curable (although there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

==Symptoms==
'''Possible Indicators of Autism Spectrum Disorders:'''
* Does not babble, point, or make meaningful gestures by 1 year of age
* Does not speak one word by 16 months
* Does not combine two words by 2 years
* Does not respond to name
* Loses language or social skills

'''Some Other Indicators:'''

* Poor eye contact
* Doesn't seem to know how to play with toys
* Excessively lines up toys or other objects
* Is attached to one particular toy or object
* Doesn't smile
* At times seems to be hearing impaired


===Social Symptoms===

From the start, typically developing infants are social beings. Early in life, they gaze at people, turn toward voices, grasp a finger, and even smile.

In contrast, most children with ASD seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. Even in the first few months of life, many do not interact and they avoid eye contact. They seem indifferent to other people, and often seem to prefer being alone. They may resist attention or passively accept hugs and cuddling. Later, they seldom seek comfort or respond to parents' displays of anger or affection in a typical way. Research has suggested that although children with ASD are attached to their parents, their expression of this attachment is unusual and difficult to &quot;read.&quot; To parents, it may seem as if their child is not attached at all Parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling, teaching, and playing with their child may feel crushed by this lack of the expected and typical attachment behavior.

Children with ASD also are slower in learning to interpret what others are thinking and feeling. Subtle social cues—whether a smile, a wink, or a grimace—may have little meaning. To a child who misses these cues, &quot;Come here&quot; always means the same thing, whether the speaker is smiling and extending her arms for a hug or frowning and planting her fists on her hips. Without the ability to interpret gestures and facial expressions, the social world may seem bewildering. To compound the problem, people with ASD have difficulty seeing things from another person's perspective. Most 5-year-olds understand that other people have different information, feelings, and goals than they have. A person with ASD may lack such understanding. This inability leaves them unable to predict or understand other people's actions.

Although not universal, it is common for people with ASD also to have difficulty regulating their emotions. This can take the form of &quot;immature&quot; behavior such as crying in class or verbal outbursts that seem inappropriate to those around them. The individual with ASD might also be disruptive and physically aggressive at times, making social relationships still more difficult. They have a tendency to &quot;lose control,&quot; particularly when they're in a strange or overwhelming environment, or when angry and frustrated. They may at times break things, attack others, or hurt themselves. In their frustration, some bang their heads, pull their hair, or bite their arms. 

===Communication Difficulties===

By age 3, most children have passed predictable milestones on the path to learning language; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when he hears his name, points when he wants a toy, and when offered something distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is &quot;no.&quot;

Some children diagnosed with ASD remain mute throughout their lives. Some infants who later show signs of ASD coo and babble during the first few months of life, but they soon stop. Others may be delayed, developing language as late as age 5 to 9. Some children may learn to use communication systems such as pictures or sign language.

Those who do speak often use language in unusual ways. They seem unable to combine words into meaningful sentences. Some speak only single words, while others repeat the same phrase over and over. Some ASD children parrot what they hear, a condition called echolalia. Although many children with no ASD go through a stage where they repeat what they hear, it normally passes by the time they are 3.

Some children only mildly affected may exhibit slight delays in language, or even seem to have precocious language and unusually large vocabularies, but have great difficulty in sustaining a conversation. The &quot;give and take&quot; of normal conversation is hard for them, although they often carry on a monologue on a favorite subject, giving no one else an opportunity to comment. Another difficulty is often the inability to understand body language, tone of voice, or &quot;phrases of speech.&quot; They might interpret a sarcastic expression such as &quot;Oh, that's just great&quot; as meaning it really IS great.

While it can be hard to understand what ASD children are saying, their body language is also difficult to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures rarely match what they are saying. Also, their tone of voice fails to reflect their feelings. A high-pitched, sing-song, or flat, robot-like voice is common. Some children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults, failing to pick up on the &quot;kid-speak&quot; that is common in their peers.

Without meaningful gestures or the language to ask for things, people with ASD are at a loss to let others know what they need. As a result, they may simply scream or grab what they want. Until they are taught better ways to express their needs, ASD children do whatever they can to get through to others. As people with ASD grow up, they can become increasingly aware of their difficulties in understanding others and in being understood. As a result they may become anxious or depressed.

===Repetitive Behaviors===

Although children with ASD usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, odd repetitive motions may set them off from other children. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or walking on their toes. Some suddenly freeze in position.

As children, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a certain way, rather than using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally moves one of the toys, the child may be tremendously upset. ASD children need, and demand, absolute consistency in their environment. A slight change in any routine—in mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, going to school at a certain time and by the same route—can be extremely disturbing. Perhaps order and sameness lend some stability in a world of confusion.

Repetitive behavior sometimes takes the form of a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all about vacuum cleaners, train schedules, or lighthouses. Often there is great interest in numbers, symbols, or science topics.

== Severity of symptoms == 

Autism presents in a wide degree of severity, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remediated enough to appear unexceptional to acquaintances.

== &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High-functioning&quot; ==

In terms of both classification and [[therapy]], autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 referred to as having &quot;low-functioning autism&quot; (LFA), while those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high functioning autism&quot; (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living, rather than to IQ.  

This discrepancy can lead to confusion among service providers who equate IQ with functioning and may refuse to serve high-IQ autistic people who are severely compromised in their ability to perform daily living tasks, or may fail to recognize the intellectual potential of many autistic people who are considered LFA.

== Asperger's and Kanner's syndrome ==

Of the most common presentations of autism, [[Kanner's syndrome]] is often described as classical autism, implying low-functioning, while [[Asperger's syndrome]] is described as a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case.

In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) the most significant difference between [[Autistic Disorder]] (Kanner's) and Asperger's Disorder is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm] while in these areas a diagnosis of Asperger's observes &quot;no clinically significant delay.&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm]

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with Autistic Disorder has fed the popular conception that ''Asperger's Syndrome'' is synonymous with HFA, or that it is a lesser disorder than ''autism''.  There is also a popular but untrue conception that autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning are automatically ''Asperger's Syndrome'', or that both are merely geeks with a medical label attached.

Autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately presented in [[Rain Man]] is an encouragement for relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as suffering from Asperger's rather than autism.

== Autism as a spectrum disorder ==

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have had some form of autism.  Autistic people may have other [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] such as dyslexia. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.  There are also cases of children developing abnormally from birth but regressing around the age of 18 months, causing some degree of controversy as to when the neurological difference involved in autism truly began.

== Rare Autism spectrum disorders ==
=== Rett Syndrome ===

Rett syndrome is relatively rare, affecting almost exclusively females, one out of 10,000 to 15,000. After a period of normal development, sometime between 6 and 18 months, autism-like symptoms begin to appear. The little girl's mental and social development regresses—she no longer responds to her parents and pulls away from any social contact. If she has been talking, she stops; she cannot control her feet; she wrings her hands. Some of the problems associated with Rett syndrome can be treated. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy can help with problems of coordination, movement, and speech.

Scientists sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have discovered that a mutation in the sequence of a single gene can cause Rett syndrome. This discovery may help doctors slow or stop the progress of the syndrome. It may also lead to methods of screening for Rett syndrome, thus enabling doctors to start treating these children much sooner, and improving the quality of life these children experience.*

===Childhood Disintegrative Disorder===

Very few children who have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis meet the criteria for childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD). An estimate based on four surveys of ASD found fewer than two children per 100,000 with ASD could be classified as having CDD. This suggests that CDD is a very rare form of ASD. It has a strong male preponderance.** Symptoms may appear by age 2, but the average age of onset is between 3 and 4 years. Until this time, the child has age-appropriate skills in communication and social relationships. The long period of normal development before regression helps differentiate CDD from Rett syndrome.

&lt;/small&gt;

== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%.

In [[2001]], [[Wired Magazine]] published an interesting speculative article [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers_pr.html The Geek Syndrome] exploring the surge in apparent autism in [[Silicon Valley]]. This is only one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior. Shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism.

== Remediation of autistic behaviors ==

Remediation of debilitating aspects of autism was long hindered not only by widespread disagreement over its nature and causes, but by lack of a recognized and effective course of therapy.

Dr. [[Bruno Bettelheim]] believed that autism was linked to trauma in early childhood, and his work was highly influential for decades.  Parents, and especially mothers, of autistics were blamed for having caused their child's condition through the withholding of affection. [[Leo Kanner]], who first described autism (''Autistic disturbances of affective contact'', 1943) originated the concept of &quot;refrigerator mothers&quot; in regard to autism, although he eventually renounced the concept.  Bettelheim took the theory further. These theories did nothing to address the fact that having more than one autistic child in a family is exceptional, not the rule.  Treatments based on these theories failed to help autistic children.

A major breakthrough in the remediation of autistic behaviors came through work spearheaded by [[Ole Ivar Lovaas]], who believed that success could be obtained by behavioral approaches.
:''Lovaas' approaches&amp;mdash;often referred to as Discrete Trial, Intensive Behavior Intervention, and Applied Behavior Analysis&amp;mdash;are some of the best known and most widely used in the field and focus on the development of attention, imitation, receptive or expressive language, and pre-academic and self-help skills. Using a one-to-one therapist-child ratio and the &amp;#8220;antecedent-behavior-consequence&amp;#8221; (ABC) model, interventions based on this work involve trials or tasks. Each consists of (a) an antecedent, which is a directive or request for the child to perform an action; (b) a behavior, or response from the child, which may be categorized as successful performance, noncompliance, or no response; and (c) a consequence, defined as the reaction from the therapist, which ranges from strong positive reinforcement to a strong negative response, &amp;#8220;No!&amp;#8221;''(Autism Society of America, 2001).[http://www.aann.org/ce/jnn04-02b.htm] 

Lovaas' ''Applied Behavioral Analysis'' (ABA) methods were the first scientifically validated therapy for autism. Early intervention, generally before school-age, is critical for children who would benefit from these programs. ABA is not for all autistic or developmentally delayed children and [http://users.1st.net/cibra/OpenLetter.htm may be seriously traumatic], causing further regression instead of progress. Before signing your child up for an ABA program, be sure you know exactly [http://users.1st.net/cibra/warningindex.htm what will be done to your child and why]. 

== Aspects of autism ==

Some things to mention here:

* the ''[[autistic savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]] and research in the US suggesting a similar link between autism and [[DPT vaccine]].

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot;&amp;mdash;the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;&amp;mdash;see [[theory of mind]]

* Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]]'s influential research and his book ''Infantile Autism'' (1967) which argued that autism was not caused by childhood trauma or abuse, but by damage to certain areas of the brain, particularly the [[reticular formation]] which associates present sensory input with memories of past experiences. Dr. Rimland is a foremost advocate of the theory that autism may be precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity.[http://www.curezone.com/art/read.asp?ID=79&amp;db=2&amp;C0=735] He also is prominent in increasingly common claims of successful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy.

* [[Relationship Development Intervention]] (RDI) is a [[proprietary]] treatment program targeting the core social/relationship deficits of autism

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life as a person with autism. [[Donna Williams]]  (''Autism: an inside-out approach'', ISBN 1-85302-387-6) and her many other books give an interesting perspective on the experience of the person with autism.  Dozens of other autistic people have also written books on autism and other topics.

== Controversies in Autism ==

Controversy exists as to whether autism, particularly (but by no means limited to) Asperger autism, is a disorder at all, or simply a variation in neurological hardwiring. Many autistics do not lack language skills (some mute autistics such as Jasmine O'Neill write very well) and desire to speak for themselves about their experience. They do not desire a cure, but rather to be given opportunities to use their unique skills and perceptions in useful ways. Websites such as [http://www.autistics.org autistics.org] present their view. 

Some people understand this attitude as an outgrowth of their perception that the word &quot;autism&quot; is fast becoming misused to define shy, intellectually-oriented children who are not extroverted nor interested in sports, or who are slightly developmentally delayed (better autistic than retarded?).  However, the original autistic people to popularize the view that autistic people need not be cured, of whom one of the most famous is Jim Sinclair, were diagnosed in a time when autism was a decidedly unpopular diagnosis.  Thus, it should also not lightly be assumed that autistic people presenting this point of view represent a misdiagnosed group.  Many have been diagnosed correctly, are not simply shy or introverted geeks with a few social quirks, experience severe problems in day to day functioning, but find that autism is still too much of an intrinsic part of themselves to want to have it indiscriminately eradicated in the name of normalcy.   Parents who are desperate for a &quot;normal&quot; child may agree to all sorts of treatments, including electroshock therapy, neuroleptic and antidepressant medication, and ABA behavioristic training -- which at its most extreme appears barbaric, to say the least.

==Adults with an Autism Spectrum Disorder==

Some adults with ASD, especially those with high-functioning autism or with Asperger syndrome, are able to work successfully in mainstream jobs. Nevertheless, communication and social problems often cause difficulties in many areas of life. 

Many others with ASD are capable of employment in sheltered workshops under the supervision of managers trained in working with persons with disabilities. A nurturing environment at home, at school, and later in job training and at work, helps persons with ASD continue to learn and to develop throughout their lives.

In the United States, the public schools' responsibility for providing services ends when the person with ASD reaches the age of 22. The family is then faced with the challenge of finding living arrangements and employment to match the particular needs of their adult child, as well as the programs and facilities that can provide support services to achieve these goals.

* Doesn't seem to know how to play with toys
* Excessively lines up toys or other objects
* Is attached to one particular toy or object
* Doesn't smile
* At times seems to be hearing impaired


===Social Symptoms===

From the start, typically developing infants are social beings. Early in life, they gaze at people, turn toward voices, grasp a finger, and even smile.

In contrast, most children with ASD seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. Even in the first few months of life, many do not interact and they avoid eye contact. They seem indifferent to other people, and often seem to prefer being alone. They may resist attention or passively accept hugs and cuddling. Later, they seldom seek comfort or respond to parents' displays of anger or affection in a typical way. Research has suggested that although children with ASD are attached to their parents, their expression of this attachment is unusual and difficult to &quot;read.&quot; To parents, it may seem as if their child is not attached at all Parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling, teaching, and playing with their child may feel crushed by this lack of the expected and typical attachment behavior.

Children with ASD also are slower in learning to interpret what others are thinking and feeling. Subtle social cues—whether a smile, a wink, or a grimace—may have little meaning. To a child who misses these cues, &quot;Come here&quot; always means the same thing, whether the speaker is smiling and extending her arms for a hug or frowning and planting her fists on her hips. Without the ability to interpret gestures and facial expressions, the social world may seem bewildering. To compound the problem, people with ASD have difficulty seeing things from another person's perspective. Most 5-year-olds understand that other people have different information, feelings, and goals than they have. A person with ASD may lack such understanding. This inability leaves them unable to predict or understand other people's actions.

Although not universal, it is common for people with ASD also to have difficulty regulating their emotions. This can take the form of &quot;immature&quot; behavior such as crying in class or verbal outbursts that seem inappropriate to those around them. The individual with ASD might also be disruptive and physically aggressive at times, making social relationships still more difficult. They have a tendency to &quot;lose control,&quot; particularly when they're in a strange or overwhelming environment, or when angry and frustrated. They may at times break things, attack others, or hurt themselves. In their frustration, some bang their heads, pull their hair, or bite their arms. 

===Communication Difficulties===

By age 3, most children have passed predictable milestones on the path to learning language; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when he hears his name, points when he wants a toy, and when offered something distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is &quot;no.&quot;

Some children diagnosed with ASD remain mute throughout their lives. Some infants who later show signs of ASD coo and babble during the first few months of life, but they soon stop. Others may be delayed, developing language as late as age 5 to 9. Some children may learn to use communication systems such as pictures or sign language.

Those who do speak often use language in unusual ways. They seem unable to combine words into meaningful sentences. Some speak only single words, while others repeat the same phrase over and over. Some ASD children parrot what they hear, a condition called echolalia. Although many children with no ASD go through a stage where they repeat what they hear, it normally passes by the time they are 3.

Some children only mildly affected may exhibit slight delays in language, or even seem to have precocious language and unusually large vocabularies, but have great difficulty in sustaining a conversation. The &quot;give and take&quot; of normal conversation is hard for them, although they often carry on a monologue on a favorite subject, giving no one else an opportunity to comment. Another difficulty is often the inability to understand body language, tone of voice, or &quot;phrases of speech.&quot; They might interpret a sarcastic expression such as &quot;Oh, that's just great&quot; as meaning it really IS great.

While it can be hard to understand what ASD children are saying, their body language is also difficult to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures rarely match what they are saying. Also, their tone of voice fails to reflect their feelings. A high-pitched, sing-song, or flat, robot-like voice is common. Some children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults, failing to pick up on the &quot;kid-speak&quot; that is common in their peers.

Without meaningful gestures or the language to ask for things, people with ASD are at a loss to let others know what they need. As a result, they may simply scream or grab what they want. Until they are taught better ways to express their needs, ASD children do whatever they can to get through to others. As people with ASD grow up, they can become increasingly aware of their difficulties in understanding others and in being understood. As a result they may become anxious or depressed.

===Repetitive Behaviors===

Although children with ASD usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, odd repetitive motions may set them off from other children. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or walking on their toes. Some suddenly freeze in position.

As children, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a certain way, rather than using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally moves one of the toys, the child may be tremendously upset. ASD children need, and demand, absolute consistency in their environment. A slight change in any routine—in mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, going to school at a certain time and by the same route—can be extremely disturbing. Perhaps order and sameness lend some stability in a world of confusion.

Repetitive behavior sometimes takes the form of a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all about vacuum cleaners, train schedules, or lighthouses. Often there is great interest in numbers, symbols, or science topics.

== Severity of symptoms == 

Autism presents in a wide degree of severity, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remediated enough to appear unexceptional to acquaintances.

== &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High-functioning&quot; ==

In terms of both classification and [[therapy]], autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 referred to as having &quot;low-functioning autism&quot; (LFA), while those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high functioning autism&quot; (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living, rather than to IQ.  

This discrepancy can lead to confusion among service providers who equate IQ with functioning and may refuse to serve high-IQ autistic people who are severely compromised in their ability to perform daily living tasks, or may fail to recognize the intellectual potential of many autistic people who are considered LFA.

== Asperger's and Kanner's syndrome ==

Of the most common presentations of autism, [[Kanner's syndrome]] is often described as classical autism, implying low-functioning, while [[Asperger's syndrome]] is described as a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case.

In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) the most significant difference between [[Autistic Disorder]] (Kanner's) and Asperger's Disorder is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm] while in these areas a diagnosis of Asperger's observes &quot;no clinically significant delay.&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm]

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with Autistic Disorder has fed the popular conception that ''Asperger's Syndrome'' is synonymous with HFA, or that it is a lesser disorder than ''autism''.  There is also a popular but untrue conception that autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning are automatically ''Asperger's Syndrome'', or that both are merely geeks with a medical label attached.

Autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately presented in [[Rain Man]] is an encouragement for relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as suffering from Asperger's rather than autism.

== Autism as a spectrum disorder ==

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have had some form of autism.  Autistic people may have other [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] such as dyslexia. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.  There are also cases of children developing abnormally from birth but regressing around the age of 18 months, causing some degree of controversy as to when the neurological difference involved in autism truly began.

== Rare Autism spectrum disorders ==
=== Rett Syndrome ===

Rett syndrome is relatively rare, affecting almost exclusively females, one out of 10,000 to 15,000. After a period of normal development, sometime between 6 and 18 months, autism-like symptoms begin to appear. The little girl's mental and social development regresses—she no longer responds to her parents and pulls away from any social contact. If she has been talking, she stops; she cannot control her feet; she wrings her hands. Some of the problems associated with Rett syndrome can be treated. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy can help with problems of coordination, movement, and speech.

Scientists sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have discovered that a mutation in the sequence of a single gene can cause Rett syndrome. This discovery may help doctors slow or stop the progress of the syndrome. It may also lead to methods of screening for Rett syndrome, thus enabling doctors to start treating these children much sooner, and improving the quality of life these children experience.*

===Childhood Disintegrative Disorder===

Very few children who have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis meet the criteria for childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD). An estimate based on four surveys of ASD found fewer than two children per 100,000 with ASD could be classified as having CDD. This suggests that CDD is a very rare form of ASD. It has a strong male preponderance.** Symptoms may appear by age 2, but the average age of onset is between 3 and 4 years. Until this time, the child has age-appropriate skills in communication and social relationships. The long period of normal development before regression helps differentiate CDD from Rett syndrome.

== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%.

In [[2001]], [[Wired Magazine]] published an interesting speculative article [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers_pr.html The Geek Syndrome] exploring the surge in apparent autism in [[Silicon Valley]]. This is only one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior. Shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism.

== Remediation of autistic behaviors ==

Remediation of debilitating aspects of autism was long hindered not only by widespread disagreement over its nature and causes, but by lack of a recognized and effective course of therapy.

Dr. [[Bruno Bettelheim]] believed that autism was linked to trauma in early childhood, and his work was highly influential for decades.  Parents, and especially mothers, of autistics were blamed for having caused their child's condition through the withholding of affection. [[Leo Kanner]], who first described autism (''Autistic disturbances of affective contact'', 1943) originated the concept of &quot;refrigerator mothers&quot; in regard to autism, although he eventually renounced the concept.  Bettelheim took the theory further. These theories did nothing to address the fact that having more than one autistic child in a family is exceptional, not the rule.  Treatments based on these theories failed to help autistic children.

A major breakthrough in the remediation of autistic behaviors came through work spearheaded by [[Ole Ivar Lovaas]], who believed that success could be obtained by behavioral approaches.
:''Lovaas' approaches&amp;mdash;often referred to as Discrete Trial, Intensive Behavior Intervention, and Applied Behavior Analysis&amp;mdash;are some of the best known and most widely used in the field and focus on the development of attention, imitation, receptive or expressive language, and pre-academic and self-help skills. Using a one-to-one therapist-child ratio and the &amp;#8220;antecedent-behavior-consequence&amp;#8221; (ABC) model, interventions based on this work involve trials or tasks. Each consists of (a) an antecedent, which is a directive or request for the child to perform an action; (b) a behavior, or response from the child, which may be categorized as successful performance, noncompliance, or no response; and (c) a consequence, defined as the reaction from the therapist, which ranges from strong positive reinforcement to a strong negative response, &amp;#8220;No!&amp;#8221;''(Autism Society of America, 2001).[http://www.aann.org/ce/jnn04-02b.htm] 

Lovaas' ''Applied Behavioral Analysis'' (ABA) methods were the first scientifically validated therapy for autism. Early intervention, generally before school-age, is critical for children who would benefit from these programs. ABA is not for all autistic or developmentally delayed children and [http://users.1st.net/cibra/OpenLetter.htm may be seriously traumatic], causing further regression instead of progress. Before signing your child up for an ABA program, be sure you know exactly [http://users.1st.net/cibra/warningindex.htm what will be done to your child and why]. 

== Aspects of autism ==

Some things to mention here:

* the ''[[autistic savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]] and research in the US suggesting a similar link between autism and [[DPT vaccine]].

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot;&amp;mdash;the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;&amp;mdash;see [[theory of mind]]

* Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]]'s influential research and his book ''Infantile Autism'' (1967) which argued that autism was not caused by childhood trauma or abuse, but by damage to certain areas of the brain, particularly the [[reticular formation]] which associates present sensory input with memories of past experiences. Dr. Rimland is a foremost advocate of the theory that autism may be precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity.[http://www.curezone.com/art/read.asp?ID=79&amp;db=2&amp;C0=735] He also is prominent in increasingly common claims of successful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy.

* [[Relationship Development Intervention]] (RDI) is a [[proprietary]] treatment program targeting the core social/relationship deficits of autism

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life as a person with autism. [[Donna Williams]]  (''Autism: an inside-out approach'', ISBN 1-85302-387-6) and her many other books give an interesting perspective on the experience of the person with autism.  Dozens of other autistic people have also written books on autism and other topics.

==Problems That may Accompany ASD==

===Sensory problems=== 
When children's perceptions are accurate, they can learn from what they see, feel, or hear. On the other hand, if sensory information is faulty, the child's experiences of the world can be confusing. Many ASD children are highly attuned or even painfully sensitive to certain sounds, textures, tastes, and smells. Some children find the feel of clothes touching their skin almost unbearable. Some sounds—a vacuum cleaner, a ringing telephone, a sudden storm, even the sound of waves lapping the shoreline—will cause these children to cover their ears and scream.

In ASD, the brain seems unable to balance the senses appropriately. Some ASD children are oblivious to extreme cold or pain. An ASD child may fall and break an arm, yet never cry. Another may bash his head against a wall and not wince, but a light touch may make the child scream with alarm.

===[[Mental retardation]]===
Many children with ASD have some degree of mental impairment. When tested, some areas of ability may be normal, while others may be especially weak. For example, a child with ASD may do well on the parts of the test that measure visual skills but earn low scores on the language subtests.

===[[Seizure]]s===
One in four children with ASD develops seizures, often starting either in early childhood or adolescence.4 Seizures, caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, can produce a temporary loss of consciousness (a &quot;blackout&quot;), a body convulsion, unusual movements, or staring spells. Sometimes a contributing factor is a lack of sleep or a high fever. An EEG (electroencephalogram—recording of the electric currents developed in the brain by means of electrodes applied to the scalp) can help confirm the seizure's presence.

In most cases, seizures can be controlled by a number of medicines called &quot;anticonvulsants.&quot; The dosage of the medication is adjusted carefully so that the least possible amount of medication will be used to be effective.

===[[Fragile X syndrome]]===
This disorder is the most common inherited form of mental retardation. It was so named because one part of the X chromosome has a defective piece that appears pinched and fragile when under a microscope. Fragile X syndrome affects about two to five percent of people with ASD. It is important to have a child with ASD checked for Fragile X, especially if the parents are considering having another child. For an unknown reason, if a child with ASD also has Fragile X, there is a one-in-two chance that boys born to the same parents will have the syndrome.5 Other members of the family who may be contemplating having a child may also wish to be checked for the syndrome.

===[[Tuberous Sclerosis]]===
Tuberous sclerosis is a rare genetic disorder that causes benign tumors to grow in the brain as well as in other vital organs. It has a consistently strong association with ASD. One to four percent of people with ASD also have tuberous sclerosis.6 

== Controversies in Autism ==

Controversy exists as to whether autism, particularly (but by no means limited to) Asperger autism, is a disorder at all, or simply a variation in neurological hardwiring. Many autistics do not lack language skills (some mute autistics such as Jasmine O'Neill write very well) and desire to speak for themselves about their experience. They do not desire a cure, but rather to be given opportunities to use their unique skills and perceptions in useful ways. Websites such as [http://www.autistics.org autistics.org] present their view. 

Some people understand this attitude as an outgrowth of their perception that the word &quot;autism&quot; is fast becoming misused to define shy, intellectually-oriented children who are not extroverted nor interested in sports, or who are slightly developmentally delayed (better autistic than retarded?).  However, the original autistic people to popularize the view that autistic people need not be cured, of whom one of the most famous is Jim Sinclair, were diagnosed in a time when autism was a decidedly unpopular diagnosis.  Thus, it should also not lightly be assumed that autistic people presenting this point of view represent a misdiagnosed group.  Many have been diagnosed correctly, are not simply shy or introverted geeks with a few social quirks, experience severe problems in day to day functioning, but find that autism is still too much of an intrinsic part of themselves to want to have it indiscriminately eradicated in the name of normalcy.   Parents who are desperate for a &quot;normal&quot; child may agree to all sorts of treatments, including electroshock therapy, neuroleptic and antidepressant medication, and ABA behavioristic training -- which at its most extreme appears barbaric, to say the least. [http://users.1st.net/cibra/index.htm Children Injured By Restraint and Aversives] presents open letters from parents on this subject.

==Adults with an Autism Spectrum Disorder==

Some adults with ASD, especially those with high-functioning autism or with Asperger syndrome, are able to work successfully in mainstream jobs. Nevertheless, communication and social problems often cause difficulties in many areas of life. 

Many others with ASD are capable of employment in sheltered workshops under the supervision of managers trained in working with persons with disabilities. A nurturing environment at home, at school, and later in job training and at work, helps persons with ASD continue to learn and to develop throughout their lives.

In the United States, the public schools' responsibility for providing services ends when the person with ASD reaches the age of 22. The family is then faced with the challenge of finding living arrangements and employment to match the particular needs of their adult child, as well as the programs and facilities that can provide support services to achieve these goals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in approximately 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and is 4 times more prevalent in males than females (source: The Autism Society of America [http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer]).  It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

[[As of 2004]], autism is treatable, but not curable (although there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

==History==
[[Image:Asperger_kl2.jpg|right|thumb|88px|Hans Asperger]]
Not until the middle of the twentieth century was there a name for a disorder that now appears to affect an estimated one of every five hundred children, a disorder that causes disruption in families and unfulfilled lives for many children. 

In 1943 Dr. [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] studied a group of 11 children and introduced the label early infantile autism into the English language. At the same time a German scientist, Dr. [[Hans Asperger]], described a milder form of the disorder that became known as Asperger syndrome. 

Thus these two disorders were described and are today listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV-TR (fourth edition, text revision)1 as two of the five pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), more often referred to today as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). All these disorders are characterized by varying degrees of impairment in communication skills, social interactions, and restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior.

[[image:kanner_kl2.jpg|right|thumb|88px|Leo Kanner]]
==Symptoms==
'''Possible Indicators of Autism Spectrum Disorders:'''
* Does not babble, point, or make meaningful gestures by 1 year of age
* Does not speak one word by 16 months
* Does not combine two words by 2 years
* Does not respond to name
* Loses language or social skills

'''Some Other Indicators:'''

* Poor eye contact
* Doesn't seem to know how to play with toys
* Excessively lines up toys or other objects
* Is attached to one particular toy or object
* Doesn't smile
* At times seems to be hearing impaired


===Social Symptoms===

From the start, typically developing infants are social beings. Early in life, they gaze at people, turn toward voices, grasp a finger, and even smile.

In contrast, most children with ASD seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. Even in the first few months of life, many do not interact and they avoid eye contact. They seem indifferent to other people, and often seem to prefer being alone. They may resist attention or passively accept hugs and cuddling. Later, they seldom seek comfort or respond to parents' displays of anger or affection in a typical way. Research has suggested that although children with ASD are attached to their parents, their expression of this attachment is unusual and difficult to &quot;read.&quot; To parents, it may seem as if their child is not attached at all Parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling, teaching, and playing with their child may feel crushed by this lack of the expected and typical attachment behavior.

Children with ASD also are slower in learning to interpret what others are thinking and feeling. Subtle social cues—whether a smile, a wink, or a grimace—may have little meaning. To a child who misses these cues, &quot;Come here&quot; always means the same thing, whether the speaker is smiling and extending her arms for a hug or frowning and planting her fists on her hips. Without the ability to interpret gestures and facial expressions, the social world may seem bewildering. To compound the problem, people with ASD have difficulty seeing things from another person's perspective. Most 5-year-olds understand that other people have different information, feelings, and goals than they have. A person with ASD may lack such understanding. This inability leaves them unable to predict or understand other people's actions.

Although not universal, it is common for people with ASD also to have difficulty regulating their emotions. This can take the form of &quot;immature&quot; behavior such as crying in class or verbal outbursts that seem inappropriate to those around them. The individual with ASD might also be disruptive and physically aggressive at times, making social relationships still more difficult. They have a tendency to &quot;lose control,&quot; particularly when they're in a strange or overwhelming environment, or when angry and frustrated. They may at times break things, attack others, or hurt themselves. In their frustration, some bang their heads, pull their hair, or bite their arms. 

===Communication Difficulties===

By age 3, most children have passed predictable milestones on the path to learning language; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when he hears his name, points when he wants a toy, and when offered something distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is &quot;no.&quot;

Some children diagnosed with ASD remain mute throughout their lives. Some infants who later show signs of ASD coo and babble during the first few months of life, but they soon stop. Others may be delayed, developing language as late as age 5 to 9. Some children may learn to use communication systems such as pictures or sign language.

Those who do speak often use language in unusual ways. They seem unable to combine words into meaningful sentences. Some speak only single words, while others repeat the same phrase over and over. Some ASD children parrot what they hear, a condition called echolalia. Although many children with no ASD go through a stage where they repeat what they hear, it normally passes by the time they are 3.

Some children only mildly affected may exhibit slight delays in language, or even seem to have precocious language and unusually large vocabularies, but have great difficulty in sustaining a conversation. The &quot;give and take&quot; of normal conversation is hard for them, although they often carry on a monologue on a favorite subject, giving no one else an opportunity to comment. Another difficulty is often the inability to understand body language, tone of voice, or &quot;phrases of speech.&quot; They might interpret a sarcastic expression such as &quot;Oh, that's just great&quot; as meaning it really IS great.

While it can be hard to understand what ASD children are saying, their body language is also difficult to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures rarely match what they are saying. Also, their tone of voice fails to reflect their feelings. A high-pitched, sing-song, or flat, robot-like voice is common. Some children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults, failing to pick up on the &quot;kid-speak&quot; that is common in their peers.

Without meaningful gestures or the language to ask for things, people with ASD are at a loss to let others know what they need. As a result, they may simply scream or grab what they want. Until they are taught better ways to express their needs, ASD children do whatever they can to get through to others. As people with ASD grow up, they can become increasingly aware of their difficulties in understanding others and in being understood. As a result they may become anxious or depressed.

===Repetitive Behaviors===

Although children with ASD usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, odd repetitive motions may set them off from other children. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or walking on their toes. Some suddenly freeze in position.

As children, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a certain way, rather than using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally moves one of the toys, the child may be tremendously upset. ASD children need, and demand, absolute consistency in their environment. A slight change in any routine—in mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, going to school at a certain time and by the same route—can be extremely disturbing. Perhaps order and sameness lend some stability in a world of confusion.

Repetitive behavior sometimes takes the form of a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all about vacuum cleaners, train schedules, or lighthouses. Often there is great interest in numbers, symbols, or science topics.

== Severity of symptoms == 

Autism presents in a wide degree of severity, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remediated enough to appear unexceptional to acquaintances.

== &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High-functioning&quot; ==

In terms of both classification and [[therapy]], autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 referred to as having &quot;low-functioning autism&quot; (LFA), while those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high functioning autism&quot; (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living, rather than to IQ.  

This discrepancy can lead to confusion among service providers who equate IQ with functioning and may refuse to serve high-IQ autistic people who are severely compromised in their ability to perform daily living tasks, or may fail to recognize the intellectual potential of many autistic people who are considered LFA.

== Asperger's and Kanner's syndrome ==

Of the most common presentations of autism, [[Kanner's syndrome]] is often described as classical autism, implying low-functioning, while [[Asperger's syndrome]] is described as a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case.

In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) the most significant difference between [[Autistic Disorder]] (Kanner's) and Asperger's Disorder is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm] while in these areas a diagnosis of Asperger's observes &quot;no clinically significant delay.&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm]

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with Autistic Disorder has fed the popular conception that ''Asperger's Syndrome'' is synonymous with HFA, or that it is a lesser disorder than ''autism''.  There is also a popular but untrue conception that autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning are automatically ''Asperger's Syndrome'', or that both are merely geeks with a medical label attached.

Autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately presented in [[Rain Man]] is an encouragement for relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as suffering from Asperger's rather than autism.

== Autism as a spectrum disorder ==

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have had some form of autism.  Autistic people may have other [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] such as dyslexia. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.  There are also cases of children developing abnormally from birth but regressing around the age of 18 months, causing some degree of controversy as to when the neurological difference involved in autism truly began.

== Rare Autism spectrum disorders ==
=== Rett Syndrome ===

Rett syndrome is relatively rare, affecting almost exclusively females, one out of 10,000 to 15,000. After a period of normal development, sometime between 6 and 18 months, autism-like symptoms begin to appear. The little girl's mental and social development regresses—she no longer responds to her parents and pulls away from any social contact. If she has been talking, she stops; she cannot control her feet; she wrings her hands. Some of the problems associated with Rett syndrome can be treated. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy can help with problems of coordination, movement, and speech.

Scientists sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have discovered that a mutation in the sequence of a single gene can cause Rett syndrome. This discovery may help doctors slow or stop the progress of the syndrome. It may also lead to methods of screening for Rett syndrome, thus enabling doctors to start treating these children much sooner, and improving the quality of life these children experience.*

===Childhood Disintegrative Disorder===

Very few children who have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis meet the criteria for childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD). An estimate based on four surveys of ASD found fewer than two children per 100,000 with ASD could be classified as having CDD. This suggests that CDD is a very rare form of ASD. It has a strong male preponderance.** Symptoms may appear by age 2, but the average age of onset is between 3 and 4 years. Until this time, the child has age-appropriate skills in communication and social relationships. The long period of normal development before regression helps differentiate CDD from Rett syndrome.

== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%.

In [[2001]], [[Wired Magazine]] published an interesting speculative article [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers_pr.html The Geek Syndrome] exploring the surge in apparent autism in [[Silicon Valley]]. This is only one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior. Shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism.

== Remediation of autistic behaviors ==

Remediation of debilitating aspects of autism was long hindered not only by widespread disagreement over its nature and causes, but by lack of a recognized and effective course of therapy.

Dr. [[Bruno Bettelheim]] believed that autism was linked to trauma in early childhood, and his work was highly influential for decades.  Parents, and especially mothers, of autistics were blamed for having caused their child's condition through the withholding of affection. [[Leo Kanner]], who first described autism (''Autistic disturbances of affective contact'', 1943) originated the concept of &quot;refrigerator mothers&quot; in regard to autism, although he eventually renounced the concept.  Bettelheim took the theory further. These theories did nothing to address the fact that having more than one autistic child in a family is exceptional, not the rule.  Treatments based on these theories failed to help autistic children.

A major breakthrough in the remediation of autistic behaviors came through work spearheaded by [[Ole Ivar Lovaas]], who believed that success could be obtained by behavioral approaches.
:''Lovaas' approaches&amp;mdash;often referred to as Discrete Trial, Intensive Behavior Intervention, and Applied Behavior Analysis&amp;mdash;are some of the best known and most widely used in the field and focus on the development of attention, imitation, receptive or expressive language, and pre-academic and self-help skills. Using a one-to-one therapist-child ratio and the &amp;#8220;antecedent-behavior-consequence&amp;#8221; (ABC) model, interventions based on this work involve trials or tasks. Each consists of (a) an antecedent, which is a directive or request for the child to perform an action; (b) a behavior, or response from the child, which may be categorized as successful performance, noncompliance, or no response; and (c) a consequence, defined as the reaction from the therapist, which ranges from strong positive reinforcement to a strong negative response, &amp;#8220;No!&amp;#8221;''(Autism Society of America, 2001).[http://www.aann.org/ce/jnn04-02b.htm] 

Lovaas' ''Applied Behavioral Analysis'' (ABA) methods were the first scientifically validated therapy for autism. Early intervention, generally before school-age, is critical for children who would benefit from these programs. ABA is not for all autistic or developmentally delayed children and [http://users.1st.net/cibra/OpenLetter.htm may be seriously traumatic], causing further regression instead of progress. Before signing your child up for an ABA program, be sure you know exactly [http://users.1st.net/cibra/warningindex.htm what will be done to your child and why]. 

== Aspects of autism ==

Some things to mention here:

* the ''[[autistic savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]] and research in the US suggesting a similar link between autism and [[DPT vaccine]].

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot;&amp;mdash;the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;&amp;mdash;see [[theory of mind]]

* Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]]'s influential research and his book ''Infantile Autism'' (1967) which argued that autism was not caused by childhood trauma or abuse, but by damage to certain areas of the brain, particularly the [[reticular formation]] which associates present sensory input with memories of past experiences. Dr. Rimland is a foremost advocate of the theory that autism may be precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity.[http://www.curezone.com/art/read.asp?ID=79&amp;db=2&amp;C0=735] He also is prominent in increasingly common claims of successful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy.

* [[Relationship Development Intervention]] (RDI) is a [[proprietary]] treatment program targeting the core social/relationship deficits of autism

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life as a person with autism. [[Donna Williams]]  (''Autism: an inside-out approach'', ISBN 1-85302-387-6) and her many other books give an interesting perspective on the experience of the person with autism.  Dozens of other autistic people have also written books on autism and other topics.

==Problems That may Accompany ASD==

===Sensory problems=== 
When children's perceptions are accurate, they can learn from what they see, feel, or hear. On the other hand, if sensory information is faulty, the child's experiences of the world can be confusing. Many ASD children are highly attuned or even painfully sensitive to certain sounds, textures, tastes, and smells. Some children find the feel of clothes touching their skin almost unbearable. Some sounds—a vacuum cleaner, a ringing telephone, a sudden storm, even the sound of waves lapping the shoreline—will cause these children to cover their ears and scream.

In ASD, the brain seems unable to balance the senses appropriately. Some ASD children are oblivious to extreme cold or pain. An ASD child may fall and break an arm, yet never cry. Another may bash his head against a wall and not wince, but a light touch may make the child scream with alarm.

===[[Mental retardation]]===
Many children with ASD have some degree of mental impairment. When tested, some areas of ability may be normal, while others may be especially weak. For example, a child with ASD may do well on the parts of the test that measure visual skills but earn low scores on the language subtests.

===[[Seizure]]s===
One in four children with ASD develops seizures, often starting either in early childhood or adolescence.4 Seizures, caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, can produce a temporary loss of consciousness (a &quot;blackout&quot;), a body convulsion, unusual movements, or staring spells. Sometimes a contributing factor is a lack of sleep or a high fever. An EEG (electroencephalogram—recording of the electric currents developed in the brain by means of electrodes applied to the scalp) can help confirm the seizure's presence.

In most cases, seizures can be controlled by a number of medicines called &quot;anticonvulsants.&quot; The dosage of the medication is adjusted carefully so that the least possible amount of medication will be used to be effective.

===[[Fragile X syndrome]]===
This disorder is the most common inherited form of mental retardation. It was so named because one part of the X chromosome has a defective piece that appears pinched and fragile when under a microscope. Fragile X syndrome affects about two to five percent of people with ASD. It is important to have a child with ASD checked for Fragile X, especially if the parents are considering having another child. For an unknown reason, if a child with ASD also has Fragile X, there is a one-in-two chance that boys born to the same parents will have the syndrome.5 Other members of the family who may be contemplating having a child may also wish to be checked for the syndrome.

===[[Tuberous Sclerosis]]===
Tuberous sclerosis is a rare genetic disorder that causes benign tumors to grow in the brain as well as in other vital organs. It has a consistently strong association with ASD. One to four percent of people with ASD also have tuberous sclerosis.6 

== Controversies in Autism ==

Controversy exists as to whether autism, particularly (but by no means limited to) Asperger autism, is a disorder at all, or simply a variation in neurological hardwiring. Many autistics do not lack language skills (some mute autistics such as Jasmine O'Neill write very well) and desire to speak for themselves about their experience. They do not desire a cure, but rather to be given opportunities to use their unique skills and perceptions in useful ways. Websites such as [http://www.autistics.org autistics.org] present their view. 

Some people understand this attitude as an outgrowth of their perception that the word &quot;autism&quot; is fast becoming misused to define shy, intellectually-oriented children who are not extroverted nor interested in sports, or who are slightly developmentally delayed (better autistic than retarded?).  However, the original autistic people to popularize the view that autistic people need not be cured, of whom one of the most famous is Jim Sinclair, were diagnosed in a time when autism was a decidedly unpopular diagnosis.  Thus, it should also not lightly be assumed that autistic people presenting this point of view represent a misdiagnosed group.  Many have been diagnosed correctly, are not simply shy or introverted geeks with a few social quirks, experience severe problems in day to day functioning, but find that autism is still too much of an intrinsic part of themselves to want to have it indiscriminately eradicated in the name of normalcy.   Parents who are desperate for a &quot;normal&quot; child may agree to all sorts of treatments, including electroshock therapy, neuroleptic and antidepressant medication, and ABA behavioristic training -- which at its most extreme appears barbaric, to say the least. [http://users.1st.net/cibra/index.htm Children Injured By Restraint and Aversives] presents open letters from parents on this subject.

==Adults with an Autism Spectrum Disorder==

Some adults with ASD, especially those with high-functioning autism or with Asperger syndrome, are able to work successfully in mainstream jobs. Nevertheless, communication and social problems often cause difficulties in many areas of life. 

Many others with ASD are capable of employment in sheltered workshops under the supervision of managers trained in working with persons with disabilities. A nurturing environment at home, at school, and later in job training and at work, helps persons with ASD continue to learn and to develop throughout their lives.

In the United States, the public schools' responsibility for providing services ends when the person with ASD reaches the age of 22. The family is then faced with the challenge of finding living arrangements and employment to match the particular needs of their adult child, as well as the programs and facilities that can provide support services to achieve these goals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in approximately 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and is 4 times more prevalent in males than females (source: The Autism Society of America [http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer]).  It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

[[As of 2004]], autism is treatable, but not curable (although there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

==History==
[[Image:Asperger_kl2.jpg|right|thumb|88px|Hans Asperger]]
Not until the middle of the twentieth century was there a name for a disorder that now appears to affect an estimated one of every five hundred children, a disorder that causes disruption in families and unfulfilled lives for many children. 

In 1943 Dr. [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] studied a group of 11 children and introduced the label early infantile autism into the English language. At the same time a German scientist, Dr. [[Hans Asperger]], described a milder form of the disorder that became known as Asperger syndrome. 

Thus these two disorders were described and are today listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV-TR (fourth edition, text revision)1 as two of the five pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), more often referred to today as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). All these disorders are characterized by varying degrees of impairment in communication skills, social interactions, and restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior.

[[image:kanner_kl2.jpg|right|thumb|88px|Leo Kanner]]
==Symptoms==
'''Possible Indicators of Autism Spectrum Disorders:'''
* Does not babble, point, or make meaningful gestures by 1 year of age
* Does not speak one word by 16 months
* Does not combine two words by 2 years
* Does not respond to name
* Loses language or social skills

'''Some Other Indicators:'''

* Poor eye contact
* Doesn't seem to know how to play with toys
* Excessively lines up toys or other objects
* Is attached to one particular toy or object
* Doesn't smile
* At times seems to be hearing impaired


===Social Symptoms===

From the start, typically developing infants are social beings. Early in life, they gaze at people, turn toward voices, grasp a finger, and even smile.

In contrast, most children with ASD seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. Even in the first few months of life, many do not interact and they avoid eye contact. They seem indifferent to other people, and often seem to prefer being alone. They may resist attention or passively accept hugs and cuddling. Later, they seldom seek comfort or respond to parents' displays of anger or affection in a typical way. Research has suggested that although children with ASD are attached to their parents, their expression of this attachment is unusual and difficult to &quot;read.&quot; To parents, it may seem as if their child is not attached at all. Parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling, teaching, and playing with their child may feel crushed by this lack of the expected and typical attachment behavior.

Children with ASD also are slower in learning to interpret what others are thinking and feeling. Subtle social cues &amp;ndash; whether a smile, a wink, or a grimace &amp;ndash; may have little meaning. To a child who misses these cues, &quot;Come here&quot; always means the same thing, whether the speaker is smiling and extending her arms for a hug or frowning and planting her fists on her hips. Without the ability to interpret gestures and facial expressions, the social world may seem bewildering. To compound the problem, people with ASD have difficulty seeing things from another person's perspective. Most 5-year-olds understand that other people have different information, feelings, and goals than they have. A person with ASD may lack such understanding. This inability leaves them unable to predict or understand other people's actions.

Although not universal, it is common for people with ASD also to have difficulty regulating their emotions. This can take the form of &quot;immature&quot; behavior such as crying in class or verbal outbursts that seem inappropriate to those around them. The individual with ASD might also be disruptive and physically aggressive at times, making social relationships still more difficult. They have a tendency to &quot;lose control,&quot; particularly when they're in a strange or overwhelming environment, or when angry and frustrated. They may at times break things, attack others, or hurt themselves. In their frustration, some bang their heads, pull their hair, or bite their arms.

===Communication Difficulties===

By age 3, most children have passed predictable milestones on the path to learning language; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when he hears his name, points when he wants a toy, and when offered something distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is &quot;no.&quot;

Some children diagnosed with ASD remain mute throughout their lives. Some infants who later show signs of ASD coo and babble during the first few months of life, but they soon stop. Others may be delayed, developing language as late as age 5 to 9. Some children may learn to use communication systems such as pictures or sign language.

Those who do speak often use language in unusual ways. They seem unable to combine words into meaningful sentences. Some speak only single words, while others repeat the same phrase over and over. Some ASD children parrot what they hear, a condition called echolalia. Although many children with no ASD go through a stage where they repeat what they hear, it normally passes by the time they are 3.

Some children only mildly affected may exhibit slight delays in language, or even seem to have precocious language and unusually large vocabularies, but have great difficulty in sustaining a conversation. The &quot;give and take&quot; of normal conversation is hard for them, although they often carry on a monologue on a favorite subject, giving no one else an opportunity to comment. Another difficulty is often the inability to understand body language, tone of voice, or &quot;phrases of speech.&quot; They might interpret a sarcastic expression such as &quot;Oh, that's just great&quot; as meaning it really IS great.

While it can be hard to understand what ASD children are saying, their body language is also difficult to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures rarely match what they are saying. Also, their tone of voice fails to reflect their feelings. A high-pitched, sing-song, or flat, robot-like voice is common. Some children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults, failing to pick up on the &quot;kid-speak&quot; that is common in their peers.

Without meaningful gestures or the language to ask for things, people with ASD are at a loss to let others know what they need. As a result, they may simply scream or grab what they want. Until they are taught better ways to express their needs, ASD children do whatever they can to get through to others. As people with ASD grow up, they can become increasingly aware of their difficulties in understanding others and in being understood. As a result they may become anxious or depressed.

===Repetitive Behaviors===

Although children with ASD usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, odd repetitive motions may set them off from other children. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or walking on their toes. Some suddenly freeze in position.

As children, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a certain way, rather than using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally moves one of the toys, the child may be tremendously upset. ASD children need, and demand, absolute consistency in their environment. A slight change in any routine—in mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, going to school at a certain time and by the same route—can be extremely disturbing. Perhaps order and sameness lend some stability in a world of confusion.

Repetitive behavior sometimes takes the form of a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all about vacuum cleaners, train schedules, or lighthouses. Often there is great interest in numbers, symbols, or science topics.

== Severity of symptoms == 

Autism presents in a wide degree of severity, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remediated enough to appear unexceptional to acquaintances.

== &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High-functioning&quot; ==

In terms of both classification and [[therapy]], autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 referred to as having &quot;low-functioning autism&quot; (LFA), while those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high functioning autism&quot; (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living, rather than to IQ.  

This discrepancy can lead to confusion among service providers who equate IQ with functioning and may refuse to serve high-IQ autistic people who are severely compromised in their ability to perform daily living tasks, or may fail to recognize the intellectual potential of many autistic people who are considered LFA.

== Asperger's and Kanner's syndrome ==

Of the most common presentations of autism, [[Kanner's syndrome]] is often described as classical autism, implying low-functioning, while [[Asperger's syndrome]] is described as a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case.

In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) the most significant difference between [[Autistic Disorder]] (Kanner's) and Asperger's Disorder is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm] while in these areas a diagnosis of Asperger's observes &quot;no clinically significant delay.&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm]

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with Autistic Disorder has fed the popular conception that ''Asperger's Syndrome'' is synonymous with HFA, or that it is a lesser disorder than ''autism''.  There is also a popular but untrue conception that autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning are automatically ''Asperger's Syndrome'', or that both are merely geeks with a medical label attached.

Autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately presented in [[Rain Man]] is an encouragement for relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as suffering from Asperger's rather than autism.

== Autism as a spectrum disorder ==

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have had some form of autism.  Autistic people may have other [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] such as dyslexia. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.  There are also cases of children developing abnormally from birth but regressing around the age of 18 months, causing some degree of controversy as to when the neurological difference involved in autism truly began.

== Rare Autism spectrum disorders ==
=== Rett Syndrome ===

Rett syndrome is relatively rare, affecting almost exclusively females, one out of 10,000 to 15,000. After a period of normal development, sometime between 6 and 18 months, autism-like symptoms begin to appear. The little girl's mental and social development regresses—she no longer responds to her parents and pulls away from any social contact. If she has been talking, she stops; she cannot control her feet; she wrings her hands. Some of the problems associated with Rett syndrome can be treated. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy can help with problems of coordination, movement, and speech.

Scientists sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have discovered that a mutation in the sequence of a single gene can cause Rett syndrome. This discovery may help doctors slow or stop the progress of the syndrome. It may also lead to methods of screening for Rett syndrome, thus enabling doctors to start treating these children much sooner, and improving the quality of life these children experience.*

===Childhood Disintegrative Disorder===

Very few children who have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis meet the criteria for childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD). An estimate based on four surveys of ASD found fewer than two children per 100,000 with ASD could be classified as having CDD. This suggests that CDD is a very rare form of ASD. It has a strong male preponderance.** Symptoms may appear by age 2, but the average age of onset is between 3 and 4 years. Until this time, the child has age-appropriate skills in communication and social relationships. The long period of normal development before regression helps differentiate CDD from Rett syndrome.

== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%.

In [[2001]], [[Wired Magazine]] published an interesting speculative article [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers_pr.html The Geek Syndrome] exploring the surge in apparent autism in [[Silicon Valley]]. This is only one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior. Shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism.

== Remediation of autistic behaviors ==

Remediation of debilitating aspects of autism was long hindered not only by widespread disagreement over its nature and causes, but by lack of a recognized and effective course of therapy.

Dr. [[Bruno Bettelheim]] believed that autism was linked to trauma in early childhood, and his work was highly influential for decades.  Parents, and especially mothers, of autistics were blamed for having caused their child's condition through the withholding of affection. [[Leo Kanner]], who first described autism (''Autistic disturbances of affective contact'', 1943) originated the concept of &quot;refrigerator mothers&quot; in regard to autism, although he eventually renounced the concept.  Bettelheim took the theory further. These theories did nothing to address the fact that having more than one autistic child in a family is exceptional, not the rule.  Treatments based on these theories failed to help autistic children.

A major breakthrough in the remediation of autistic behaviors came through work spearheaded by [[Ole Ivar Lovaas]], who believed that success could be obtained by behavioral approaches.
:''Lovaas' approaches&amp;mdash;often referred to as Discrete Trial, Intensive Behavior Intervention, and Applied Behavior Analysis&amp;mdash;are some of the best known and most widely used in the field and focus on the development of attention, imitation, receptive or expressive language, and pre-academic and self-help skills. Using a one-to-one therapist-child ratio and the &amp;#8220;antecedent-behavior-consequence&amp;#8221; (ABC) model, interventions based on this work involve trials or tasks. Each consists of (a) an antecedent, which is a directive or request for the child to perform an action; (b) a behavior, or response from the child, which may be categorized as successful performance, noncompliance, or no response; and (c) a consequence, defined as the reaction from the therapist, which ranges from strong positive reinforcement to a strong negative response, &amp;#8220;No!&amp;#8221;''(Autism Society of America, 2001).[http://www.aann.org/ce/jnn04-02b.htm] 

Lovaas' ''Applied Behavioral Analysis'' (ABA) methods were the first scientifically validated therapy for autism. Early intervention, generally before school-age, is critical for children who would benefit from these programs. ABA is not for all autistic or developmentally delayed children and [http://users.1st.net/cibra/OpenLetter.htm may be seriously traumatic], causing further regression instead of progress. Before signing your child up for an ABA program, be sure you know exactly [http://users.1st.net/cibra/warningindex.htm what will be done to your child and why]. 

== Aspects of autism ==

Some things to mention here:

* the ''[[autistic savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]] and research in the US suggesting a similar link between autism and [[DPT vaccine]].

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot;&amp;mdash;the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;&amp;mdash;see [[theory of mind]]

* Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]]'s influential research and his book ''Infantile Autism'' (1967) which argued that autism was not caused by childhood trauma or abuse, but by damage to certain areas of the brain, particularly the [[reticular formation]] which associates present sensory input with memories of past experiences. Dr. Rimland is a foremost advocate of the theory that autism may be precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity.[http://www.curezone.com/art/read.asp?ID=79&amp;db=2&amp;C0=735] He also is prominent in increasingly common claims of successful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy.

* [[Relationship Development Intervention]] (RDI) is a [[proprietary]] treatment program targeting the core social/relationship deficits of autism

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life as a person with autism. [[Donna Williams]]  (''Autism: an inside-out approach'', ISBN 1-85302-387-6) and her many other books give an interesting perspective on the experience of the person with autism.  Dozens of other autistic people have also written books on autism and other topics.

==Problems That may Accompany ASD==

===Sensory problems=== 
When children's perceptions are accurate, they can learn from what they see, feel, or hear. On the other hand, if sensory information is faulty, the child's experiences of the world can be confusing. Many ASD children are highly attuned or even painfully sensitive to certain sounds, textures, tastes, and smells. Some children find the feel of clothes touching their skin almost unbearable. Some sounds—a vacuum cleaner, a ringing telephone, a sudden storm, even the sound of waves lapping the shoreline—will cause these children to cover their ears and scream.

In ASD, the brain seems unable to balance the senses appropriately. Some ASD children are oblivious to extreme cold or pain. An ASD child may fall and break an arm, yet never cry. Another may bash his head against a wall and not wince, but a light touch may make the child scream with alarm.

===[[Mental retardation]]===
Many children with ASD have some degree of mental impairment. When tested, some areas of ability may be normal, while others may be especially weak. For example, a child with ASD may do well on the parts of the test that measure visual skills but earn low scores on the language subtests.

===[[Seizure]]s===
One in four children with ASD develops seizures, often starting either in early childhood or adolescence.4 Seizures, caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, can produce a temporary loss of consciousness (a &quot;blackout&quot;), a body convulsion, unusual movements, or staring spells. Sometimes a contributing factor is a lack of sleep or a high fever. An EEG (electroencephalogram—recording of the electric currents developed in the brain by means of electrodes applied to the scalp) can help confirm the seizure's presence.

In most cases, seizures can be controlled by a number of medicines called &quot;anticonvulsants.&quot; The dosage of the medication is adjusted carefully so that the least possible amount of medication will be used to be effective.

===[[Fragile X syndrome]]===
This disorder is the most common inherited form of mental retardation. It was so named because one part of the X chromosome has a defective piece that appears pinched and fragile when under a microscope. Fragile X syndrome affects about two to five percent of people with ASD. It is important to have a child with ASD checked for Fragile X, especially if the parents are considering having another child. For an unknown reason, if a child with ASD also has Fragile X, there is a one-in-two chance that boys born to the same parents will have the syndrome.5 Other members of the family who may be contemplating having a child may also wish to be checked for the syndrome.

===[[Tuberous Sclerosis]]===
Tuberous sclerosis is a rare genetic disorder that causes benign tumors to grow in the brain as well as in other vital organs. It has a consistently strong association with ASD. One to four percent of people with ASD also have tuberous sclerosis.6 

== Controversies in Autism ==

Controversy exists as to whether autism, particularly (but by no means limited to) Asperger autism, is a disorder at all, or simply a variation in neurological hardwiring. Many autistics do not lack language skills (some mute autistics such as Jasmine O'Neill write very well) and desire to speak for themselves about their experience. They do not desire a cure, but rather to be given opportunities to use their unique skills and perceptions in useful ways. Websites such as [http://www.autistics.org autistics.org] present their view. 

Some people understand this attitude as an outgrowth of their perception that the word &quot;autism&quot; is fast becoming misused to define shy, intellectually-oriented children who are not extroverted nor interested in sports, or who are slightly developmentally delayed (better autistic than retarded?).  However, the original autistic people to popularize the view that autistic people need not be cured, of whom one of the most famous is Jim Sinclair, were diagnosed in a time when autism was a decidedly unpopular diagnosis.  Thus, it should also not lightly be assumed that autistic people presenting this point of view represent a misdiagnosed group.  Many have been diagnosed correctly, are not simply shy or introverted geeks with a few social quirks, experience severe problems in day to day functioning, but find that autism is still too much of an intrinsic part of themselves to want to have it indiscriminately eradicated in the name of normalcy.   Parents who are desperate for a &quot;normal&quot; child may agree to all sorts of treatments, including electroshock therapy, neuroleptic and antidepressant medication, and ABA behavioristic training -- which at its most extreme appears barbaric, to say the least. [http://users.1st.net/cibra/index.htm Children Injured By Restraint and Aversives] presents open letters from parents on this subject.

==Adults with an Autism Spectrum Disorder==

Some adults with ASD, especially those with high-functioning autism or with Asperger syndrome, are able to work successfully in mainstream jobs. Nevertheless, communication and social problems often cause difficulties in many areas of life. 

Many others with ASD are capable of employment in sheltered workshops under the supervision of managers trained in working with persons with disabilities. A nurturing environment at home, at school, and later in job training and at work, helps persons with ASD continue to learn and to develop throughout their lives.

In the United States, the public schools' responsibility for providing services ends when the person with ASD reaches the age of 22. The family is then faced with the challenge of finding living arrangements and employment to match the particular needs of their adult child, as well as the programs and facilities that can provide support services to achieve these goals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism''' is a complex [[pervasive developmental disorder]] that involves the functioning of the [[brain]]. It is a [[neurological]] [[disability]] and not simply a [[psychiatric disorder]], even though typical characteristics include problems with social relationships and emotional communication, as well as stereotyped patterns of interests, activities and behaviors. It also involves problems with sensory integration. Typically, it appears during the first three years of life. It is estimated that it occurs in approximately 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals, and is 4 times more prevalent in males than females (source: The Autism Society of America [http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer]).  It is most prevalent in Caucasian males.

[[As of 2004]], autism is treatable, but not curable (although there is an organization called &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;). Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to the future development of the child.

==History==
[[Image:Asperger_kl2.jpg|right|thumb|88px|Hans Asperger]]
Not until the middle of the twentieth century was there a name for a disorder that now appears to affect an estimated one of every five hundred children, a disorder that causes disruption in families and unfulfilled lives for many children. 

In 1943 Dr. [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] studied a group of 11 children and introduced the label early infantile autism into the English language. At the same time a German scientist, Dr. [[Hans Asperger]], described a milder form of the disorder that became known as Asperger syndrome. 

Thus these two disorders were described and are today listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV-TR (fourth edition, text revision)1 as two of the five pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), more often referred to today as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). All these disorders are characterized by varying degrees of impairment in communication skills, social interactions, and restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior.

[[image:kanner_kl2.jpg|right|thumb|88px|Leo Kanner]]
==Symptoms==
'''Possible Indicators of Autism Spectrum Disorders:'''
* Does not babble, point, or make meaningful gestures by 1 year of age
* Does not speak one word by 16 months
* Does not combine two words by 2 years
* Does not respond to name
* Loses language or social skills

'''Some Other Indicators:'''

* Poor eye contact
* Doesn't seem to know how to play with toys
* Excessively lines up toys or other objects
* Is attached to one particular toy or object
* Doesn't smile
* At times seems to be hearing impaired


===Social Symptoms===

From the start, typically developing infants are social beings. Early in life, they gaze at people, turn toward voices, grasp a finger, and even smile.

In contrast, most children with ASD seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. Even in the first few months of life, many do not interact and they avoid eye contact. They seem indifferent to other people, and often seem to prefer being alone. They may resist attention or passively accept hugs and cuddling. Later, they seldom seek comfort or respond to parents' displays of anger or affection in a typical way. Research has suggested that although children with ASD are attached to their parents, their expression of this attachment is unusual and difficult to &quot;read.&quot; To parents, it may seem as if their child is not attached at all. Parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling, teaching, and playing with their child may feel crushed by this lack of the expected and typical attachment behavior.

Children with ASD also are slower in learning to interpret what others are thinking and feeling. Subtle social cues &amp;ndash; whether a smile, a wink, or a grimace &amp;ndash; may have little meaning. To a child who misses these cues, &quot;Come here&quot; always means the same thing, whether the speaker is smiling and extending her arms for a hug or frowning and planting her fists on her hips. Without the ability to interpret gestures and facial expressions, the social world may seem bewildering. To compound the problem, people with ASD have difficulty seeing things from another person's perspective. Most 5-year-olds understand that other people have different information, feelings, and goals than they have. A person with ASD may lack such understanding. This inability leaves them unable to predict or understand other people's actions.

Although not universal, it is common for people with ASD also to have difficulty regulating their emotions. This can take the form of &quot;immature&quot; behavior such as crying in class or verbal outbursts that seem inappropriate to those around them. The individual with ASD might also be disruptive and physically aggressive at times, making social relationships still more difficult. They have a tendency to &quot;lose control,&quot; particularly when they're in a strange or overwhelming environment, or when angry and frustrated. They may at times break things, attack others, or hurt themselves. In their frustration, some bang their heads, pull their hair, or bite their arms.

===Communication Difficulties===

By age 3, most children have passed predictable milestones on the path to learning language; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when he hears his name, points when he wants a toy, and when offered something distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is &quot;no.&quot;

Some children diagnosed with ASD remain mute throughout their lives. Some infants who later show signs of ASD coo and babble during the first few months of life, but they soon stop. Others may be delayed, developing language as late as age 5 to 9. Some children may learn to use communication systems such as pictures or sign language.

Those who do speak often use language in unusual ways. They seem unable to combine words into meaningful sentences. Some speak only single words, while others repeat the same phrase over and over. Some ASD children parrot what they hear, a condition called echolalia. Although many children with no ASD go through a stage where they repeat what they hear, it normally passes by the time they are 3.

Some children only mildly affected may exhibit slight delays in language, or even seem to have precocious language and unusually large vocabularies, but have great difficulty in sustaining a conversation. The &quot;give and take&quot; of normal conversation is hard for them, although they often carry on a monologue on a favorite subject, giving no one else an opportunity to comment. Another difficulty is often the inability to understand body language, tone of voice, or &quot;phrases of speech.&quot; They might interpret a sarcastic expression such as &quot;Oh, that's just great&quot; as meaning it really ''is'' great.

While it can be hard to understand what ASD children are saying, their body language is also difficult to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures rarely match what they are saying. Also, their tone of voice fails to reflect their feelings. A high-pitched, sing-song, or flat, robot-like voice is common. Some children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults, failing to pick up on the &quot;kid-speak&quot; that is common in their peers.

Without meaningful gestures or the language to ask for things, people with ASD are at a loss to let others know what they need. As a result, they may simply scream or grab what they want. Until they are taught better ways to express their needs, ASD children do whatever they can to get through to others. As people with ASD grow up, they can become increasingly aware of their difficulties in understanding others and in being understood. As a result they may become anxious or depressed.

===Repetitive Behaviors===

Although children with ASD usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, odd repetitive motions may set them off from other children. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or walking on their toes. Some suddenly freeze in position.

As children, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a certain way, rather than using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally moves one of the toys, the child may be tremendously upset. ASD children need, and demand, absolute consistency in their environment. A slight change in any routine—in mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, going to school at a certain time and by the same route—can be extremely disturbing. Perhaps order and sameness lend some stability in a world of confusion.

Repetitive behavior sometimes takes the form of a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all about vacuum cleaners, train schedules, or lighthouses. Often there is great interest in numbers, symbols, or science topics.

== Severity of symptoms == 

Autism presents in a wide degree of severity, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remediated enough to appear unexceptional to acquaintances.

== &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High-functioning&quot; ==

In terms of both classification and [[therapy]], autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&amp;lt;80 referred to as having &quot;low-functioning autism&quot; (LFA), while those with IQ&amp;gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high functioning autism&quot; (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living, rather than to IQ.  

This discrepancy can lead to confusion among service providers who equate IQ with functioning and may refuse to serve high-IQ autistic people who are severely compromised in their ability to perform daily living tasks, or may fail to recognize the intellectual potential of many autistic people who are considered LFA.

== Asperger's and Kanner's syndrome ==

Of the most common presentations of autism, [[Kanner's syndrome]] is often described as classical autism, implying low-functioning, while [[Asperger's syndrome]] is described as a high-functioning form of autism, but this is not necessarily the case.

In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR) the most significant difference between [[Autistic Disorder]] (Kanner's) and Asperger's Disorder is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm] while in these areas a diagnosis of Asperger's observes &quot;no clinically significant delay.&quot; [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm]

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger's autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with Autistic Disorder has fed the popular conception that ''Asperger's Syndrome'' is synonymous with HFA, or that it is a lesser disorder than ''autism''.  There is also a popular but untrue conception that autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning are automatically ''Asperger's Syndrome'', or that both are merely geeks with a medical label attached.

Autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately presented in [[Rain Man]] is an encouragement for relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as suffering from Asperger's rather than autism.

== Autism as a spectrum disorder ==

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum, so can be known as [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s.  Another related continuum is [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]] which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our [[sense]]s.  Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some high-achieving individuals are thought to have had some form of autism.  Autistic people may have other [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] such as dyslexia. 

There are two main types of autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]].  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at 18 months.  There are also cases of children developing abnormally from birth but regressing around the age of 18 months, causing some degree of controversy as to when the neurological difference involved in autism truly began.

== Rare Autism spectrum disorders ==
=== Rett Syndrome ===

Rett syndrome is relatively rare, affecting almost exclusively females, one out of 10,000 to 15,000. After a period of normal development, sometime between 6 and 18 months, autism-like symptoms begin to appear. The little girl's mental and social development regresses—she no longer responds to her parents and pulls away from any social contact. If she has been talking, she stops; she cannot control her feet; she wrings her hands. Some of the problems associated with Rett syndrome can be treated. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy can help with problems of coordination, movement, and speech.

Scientists sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have discovered that a mutation in the sequence of a single gene can cause Rett syndrome. This discovery may help doctors slow or stop the progress of the syndrome. It may also lead to methods of screening for Rett syndrome, thus enabling doctors to start treating these children much sooner, and improving the quality of life these children experience.*

===Childhood Disintegrative Disorder===

Very few children who have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis meet the criteria for childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD). An estimate based on four surveys of ASD found fewer than two children per 100,000 with ASD could be classified as having CDD. This suggests that CDD is a very rare form of ASD. It has a strong male preponderance.** Symptoms may appear by age 2, but the average age of onset is between 3 and 4 years. Until this time, the child has age-appropriate skills in communication and social relationships. The long period of normal development before regression helps differentiate CDD from Rett syndrome.

== Increase in diagnoses of autism ==

There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. However, studies have ruled out the speculation that the rise is attributable to an improvement in diagnostic methods. 

In the last decade, the population of the United States has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%.

In [[2001]], [[Wired Magazine]] published an interesting speculative article [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers_pr.html The Geek Syndrome] exploring the surge in apparent autism in [[Silicon Valley]]. This is only one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior. Shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism.

== Remediation of autistic behaviors ==

Remediation of debilitating aspects of autism was long hindered not only by widespread disagreement over its nature and causes, but by lack of a recognized and effective course of therapy.

Dr. [[Bruno Bettelheim]] believed that autism was linked to trauma in early childhood, and his work was highly influential for decades.  Parents, and especially mothers, of autistics were blamed for having caused their child's condition through the withholding of affection. [[Leo Kanner]], who first described autism (''Autistic disturbances of affective contact'', 1943) originated the concept of &quot;refrigerator mothers&quot; in regard to autism, although he eventually renounced the concept.  Bettelheim took the theory further. These theories did nothing to address the fact that having more than one autistic child in a family is exceptional, not the rule.  Treatments based on these theories failed to help autistic children.

A major breakthrough in the remediation of autistic behaviors came through work spearheaded by [[Ole Ivar Lovaas]], who believed that success could be obtained by behavioral approaches.
:''Lovaas' approaches&amp;mdash;often referred to as Discrete Trial, Intensive Behavior Intervention, and Applied Behavior Analysis&amp;mdash;are some of the best known and most widely used in the field and focus on the development of attention, imitation, receptive or expressive language, and pre-academic and self-help skills. Using a one-to-one therapist-child ratio and the &amp;#8220;antecedent-behavior-consequence&amp;#8221; (ABC) model, interventions based on this work involve trials or tasks. Each consists of (a) an antecedent, which is a directive or request for the child to perform an action; (b) a behavior, or response from the child, which may be categorized as successful performance, noncompliance, or no response; and (c) a consequence, defined as the reaction from the therapist, which ranges from strong positive reinforcement to a strong negative response, &amp;#8220;No!&amp;#8221;''(Autism Society of America, 2001).[http://www.aann.org/ce/jnn04-02b.htm] 

Lovaas' ''Applied Behavioral Analysis'' (ABA) methods were the first scientifically validated therapy for autism. Early intervention, generally before school-age, is critical for children who would benefit from these programs. ABA is not for all autistic or developmentally delayed children and [http://users.1st.net/cibra/OpenLetter.htm may be seriously traumatic], causing further regression instead of progress. Before signing your child up for an ABA program, be sure you know exactly [http://users.1st.net/cibra/warningindex.htm what will be done to your child and why]. 

== Aspects of autism ==

Some things to mention here:

* the ''[[autistic savant]]'' phenomenon occasionally seen in people with autism

* recent (very controversial) research in the UK suggesting a possible link between autism and the [[MMR vaccine]] and research in the US suggesting a similar link between autism and [[DPT vaccine]].

* the analysis of autism as &quot;mind blindness&quot;&amp;mdash;the inability to create models of other people's thoughts. the typical example of this is &quot;where does X look for the object they stored, but which was moved by Y&quot;&amp;mdash;see [[theory of mind]]

* Dr. [[Bernard Rimland]]'s influential research and his book ''Infantile Autism'' (1967) which argued that autism was not caused by childhood trauma or abuse, but by damage to certain areas of the brain, particularly the [[reticular formation]] which associates present sensory input with memories of past experiences. Dr. Rimland is a foremost advocate of the theory that autism may be precipitated by mercury/heavy metal toxicity.[http://www.curezone.com/art/read.asp?ID=79&amp;db=2&amp;C0=735] He also is prominent in increasingly common claims of successful treatment of autism in children with the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]] &amp; mercury [[chelation]] therapy.

* [[Relationship Development Intervention]] (RDI) is a [[proprietary]] treatment program targeting the core social/relationship deficits of autism

Both [[Oliver Sacks]] and [[Torey Hayden]] have written about their autistic patients or pupils, respectively. [[Temple Grandin]] has also written about her own life as a person with autism. [[Donna Williams]]  (''Autism: an inside-out approach'', ISBN 1-85302-387-6) and her many other books give an interesting perspective on the experience of the person with autism.  Dozens of other autistic people have also written books on autism and other topics.

==Problems That may Accompany ASD==

===Sensory problems=== 
When children's perceptions are accurate, they can learn from what they see, feel, or hear. On the other hand, if sensory information is faulty, the child's experiences of the world can be confusing. Many ASD children are highly attuned or even painfully sensitive to certain sounds, textures, tastes, and smells. Some children find the feel of clothes touching their skin almost unbearable. Some sounds—a vacuum cleaner, a ringing telephone, a sudden storm, even the sound of waves lapping the shoreline—will cause these children to cover their ears and scream.

In ASD, the brain seems unable to balance the senses appropriately. Some ASD children are oblivious to extreme cold or pain. An ASD child may fall and break an arm, yet never cry. Another may bash his head against a wall and not wince, but a light touch may make the child scream with alarm.

===[[Mental retardation]]===
Many children with ASD have some degree of mental impairment. When tested, some areas of ability may be normal, while others may be especially weak. For example, a child with ASD may do well on the parts of the test that measure visual skills but earn low scores on the language subtests.

===[[Seizure]]s===
One in four children with ASD develops seizures, often starting either in early childhood or adolescence.4 Seizures, caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, can produce a temporary loss of consciousness (a &quot;blackout&quot;), a body convulsion, unusual movements, or staring spells. Sometimes a contributing factor is a lack of sleep or a high fever. An EEG (electroencephalogram—recording of the electric currents developed in the brain by means of electrodes applied to the scalp) can help confirm the seizure's presence.

In most cases, seizures can be controlled by a number of medicines called &quot;anticonvulsants.&quot; The dosage of the medication is adjusted carefully so that the least possible amount of medication will be used to be effective.

===[[Fragile X syndrome]]===
This disorder is the most common inherited form of mental retardation. It was so named because one part of the X chromosome has a defective piece that appears pinched and fragile when under a microscope. Fragile X syndrome affects about two to five percent of people with ASD. It is important to have a child with ASD checked for Fragile X, especially if the parents are considering having another child. For an unknown reason, if a child with ASD also has Fragile X, there is a one-in-two chance that boys born to the same parents will have the syndrome.5 Other members of the family who may be contemplating having a child may also wish to be checked for the syndrome.

===[[Tuberous Sclerosis]]===
Tuberous sclerosis is a rare genetic disorder that causes benign tumors to grow in the brain as well as in other vital organs. It has a consistently strong association with ASD. One to four percent of people with ASD also have tuberous sclerosis.6 

== Controversies in Autism ==

Controversy exists as to whether autism, particularly (but by no means limited to) Asperger autism, is a disorder at all, or simply a variation in neurological hardwiring. Many autistics do not lack language skills (some mute autistics such as Jasmine O'Neill write very well) and desire to speak for themselves about their experience. They do not desire a cure, but rather to be given opportunities to use their unique skills and perceptions in useful ways. Websites such as [http://www.autistics.org autistics.org] present their view. 

Some people understand this attitude as an outgrowth of their perception that the word &quot;autism&quot; is fast becoming misused to define shy, intellectually-oriented children who are not extroverted nor interested in sports, or who are slightly developmentally delayed (better autistic than retarded?).  However, the original autistic people to popularize the view that autistic people need not be cured, of whom one of the most famous is Jim Sinclair, were diagnosed in a time when autism was a decidedly unpopular diagnosis.  Thus, it should also not lightly be assumed that autistic people presenting this point of view represent a misdiagnosed group.  Many have been diagnosed correctly, are not simply shy or introverted geeks with a few social quirks, experience severe problems in day to day functioning, but find that autism is still too much of an intrinsic part of themselves to want to have it indiscriminately eradicated in the name of normalcy.   Parents who are desperate for a &quot;normal&quot; child may agree to all sorts of treatments, including electroshock therapy, neuroleptic and antidepressant medication, and ABA behavioristic training -- which at its most extreme appears barbaric, to say the least. [http://users.1st.net/cibra/index.htm Children Injured By Restraint and Aversives] presents open letters from parents on this subject.

==Adults with an Autism Spectrum Disorder==

Some adults with ASD, especially those with high-functioning autism or with Asperger syndrome, are able to work successfully in mainstream jobs. Nevertheless, communication and social problems often cause difficulties in many areas of life. 

Many others with ASD are capable of employment in sheltered workshops under the supervision of managers trained in working with persons with disabilities. A nurturing environment at home, at school, and later in job training and at work, helps persons with ASD continue to learn and to develop throughout their lives.

In the United States, the public schools' responsibility for providing services ends when the person with ASD reaches the age of 22. The family is then faced with the challenge of finding living arrangements and employment to match the particular needs of their adult child, as well as the programs and facilities that can provide support services to achieve these goals.

ALBEDO:



ALBEDO:



1. Introduction

Albedo is a measure of the tendency of a surface to absorb and re-emit incoming radiation, and thus lower its own temperature. Its value ranges from 0% for an object that absorbs all radiation to 100% for an object that reflects all radiation. Every molecule of every substance has its own albedo, but albedo can also refer to a collection of very many objects, and can even be applied to objects of a very large scale, such as the planet Earth, which has an albedo of 38% (Walker, 1987).





2. General Overview

Since albedo can greatly affect the temperature of an area, it is advantageous for people, especially in cold climates, to settle in areas where the albedo is very low, so that they can get as much warmth as possible from the sun. The reverse is true in desert and tropical climates; people want to live in areas where as much solar radiation as possible will be emitted back into space. According to the National Climatic Data Center’s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at Fairbanks, Alaska, is about 5°F warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of pine trees and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late winter months, when solar radiation is greater. To give another example, the entire nation of Belgium, which is among the most urbanized in the world, is considerably warmer than the mostly open, unforested French countryside that lies to its immediate southwest, perhaps also because of albedo effects.





3. Examples

a. Kilimanjaro

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of the earth, because more snow falls there, it is acually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When Brazilian ranchers cut down dark, tropical rainforest trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area increases by an average of about 5°F year-round (Kaczynski 1991). The difference would most likely be more than 30°F if the landscape of the rainforest was white instead of dark green. As evidence for this theory, scientists have climbed to the top of Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, which is located in an area well described as “steaming jungle”. But Kilimanjaro’s temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level. Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 81°F (this is the GHCN’s record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 2°F per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 41°F, which is much warmer than the approximately 20°F that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Loa, which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 40°F, despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.



But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is 14°F, which reduced to sea level at a rate of 2°F gives 42°F, which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 74°F, and it is during the dry season a dry 77°F, so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 2°F per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.



The only possible explanation is that on Kilimanjaro, a glacier built up when the climate was colder, and that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat to keep itself cold enough to not melt, and to keep the air temperature at the summit much lower than that atop Mauna Loa. This very wide gap in temperatures, of nearly 20°F, occurs despite the fact that the skies above both mountains are very cloudy and the climate of both is very wet, so not much solar radiation reaches either summit. If Mauna Loa were completely dry, it could be expected that its temperature would be even warmer, perhaps as warm as that of Tibet at 14,000 feet in summer.



b. Greenland

Another good example of albedo in action is Greenland. Greenland is an island covered almost completely with ice. In the winter, very little sunlight reaches Greenland, so albedo is not as important. But in the summertime, it makes a very big difference, making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally be for a given latitude and elevation. For example, Eismitte is a weather station situated a bit south of the geographical center of the island (near 70°N) at an altitude of 9843 feet. The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70°N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 55°F. Given a lapse rate of 2°F per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 35°F. In fact, 2°F per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only 10°F, and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only 2°F. June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 2°F lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland’s ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 2°F per 1000 feet lapse rate.



c. Svalbard

Svalbard is a group of islands extending from about 75°N to 80°N in the very warmest part of the Arctic Ocean, the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as 19°F at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about –20°F but have fallen as low as –70°F. This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.



d. Near the North Pole

Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above. The temperature of the purest Arctic Ocean water is roughly 28°F at all depths, in all seasons (Rocky and Bullwinkle, 1970). The temperature of the ice above, however, is much colder because it reflects away some of the heat of the water below it. During the summertime, the upward face of the ice reflects away solar heat and prevents itself from melting completely. The ice that does melt helps keep the average July temperatures at the North Pole at about 31°F.





4. Human adaptations

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than if they wear white clothes. Ironically, dark skin also serves to aggravate heat loss during the hot summer months, although the human body’s blood circulation is much more powerful than the albedo effect of its skin. Thus children, much skinnier than adults, need more clothes in the wintertime to keep them warm, even if they are dark-skinned. 



However, it has often been speculated (Neunke 2000) that dark hair might serve the purpose of keeping people warm during extremely cold weather, since much heat escapes through the head. Dr. Matthew Neunke points out that in Russia, for example, the native peoples living furthest west, where the climate is warmer, have the lightest hair, whereas in the east they are all dark-haired. This theory has never been satisfactorily proven, however, because of the many other bodily processes that keep people warm. Also, it fails to explain why the majority of aboriginal people living in sunny and tropical climates have dark hair as well. According to Neunke’s theory, African aboriginal people should all be light-skinned, red-eyed, white-haired people, and Northern Europeans, who survived the Ice Ages, should be dark-skinned and swarthy. Dr. Neunke objects that blonde hair is an adaptation to camouflage in the snow (yellow snow, apparently), but at this point it is clear that he has no idea what he is talking about. Dr. Neunke is a respected authority on the subject of why white people are innocent little angels who are being outpopulated by big evil black people, but he has little knowledge of meteorology or medicine. It can safely be assumed that skin and hair color has little effect on a person’s internal body temperature. 





5. Real-World Environments.

There is a simple relationship between the albedo of an area of the earth’s surface and its color. The lighter the color, the higher the albedo. A white substance would have an albedo of 1.00, or 100%, while a black substance would have an albedo of 0.00 or 0%. The human eye perceives green light especially well, so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think. For example, the albedo of a pine forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9% (Walker 1987), among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. The ocean, because it is so deep, is even lower, at about 3.5% (the surface temperature of the ocean at the equator is over 100°F (Kaczynski)). Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. All of these measurements were taken from Edward Walker’s study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45°N, but with different values for latitude and day, they would be different. The reason for this is not because of the amount of sunlight coming in, which does not change a substance’s albedo, but because the actual environments would be different in summer. For example, a cultivated field may come in as high as the low 20s, depending on the crop being cultivated. Because of increased photosynthesis, all of the values for the forests and swamp lands are nearly doubled in the summer. The grassy field, however, remains at 20% regardless of season or latitude. Near the equator, particularly in rainforest areas, the soil is very black, and its albedo is very close to 0. Some shallow lakes may have albedos as high as 45% during times when the sun is striking the lake from a very acute angle, and more of its light is reflected. Alpine areas often have strange albedo values because of the unusual land formations. 



Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 



Snow is the greatest source of albedo in the world, with an albedo that can be as high as 98% (Walker 1987). This is for the ideal example, however: deep snow over a treeless landscape with no obstacles around. In the real world, the maximum albedo depends on the environment. Thus, even in the middle of winter with a heavy snow cover, the albedo of weather stations in the pine-forested areas from Europe to Siberia and in the Americas rarely goes above 40%, and many stations in this area have averages around 25%. Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50’s in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world (Rocky and Bullwinkle).





6. Global Warming?

a. Overview

Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that the earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 20°F colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place.



If the theory of global warming is true, and the polar regions of the planet are going to be rapidly warming up, then the magnitude and path of the warming trend will depend largely on the albedo of the earth’s polar regions, and to a lesser extent on the albedo of the whole planet. Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect (Kaczynski). But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo. If the ice were to melt, the very high-albedo ice would be replaced with some very low-albedo water, and temperatures would rise enormously, perhaps as much as 15°F, which would make the area warmer than any other area at that latitude. (This is what accounts for the unusually warm summers on the islands of Svalbard, in Norway. But Svalbard is surrounded by ocean, whereas the Davis Strait is surrounded by land, and thus has the potential to become even warmer than Svalbard.)



If the ice melted, then there would be a way for the warm waters of the Gulf Stream to penetrate deep into the Arctic, and warm spells would become increasingly frequent. This could accelerate the melting of the Arctic Ocean, a process which would feed on itself. A melted Arctic would help many people living in Arctic areas, but could possibly hurt many others living in other parts of the globe. 



b. Melting the Arctic

In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old Soviet plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again. Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about 31°F (Rocky and Bullwinkle), and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 42°F.)



c. Clouds

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models such as the one at http://climate.gsfc.nasa.gov/~cahalan/FractalClouds/Movies have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about –240°F. This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 9°F temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, all we would need to do is increase the earth’s overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 



Other scientists, noting the effect of volcanic eruptions on global temperatures, have suggested other ideas, some of which are actually practical, to stop global warming by increasing the earth’s albedo. While all of these solutions are expensive and would require cooperation from powerful nations, they show that the problem of global warming is not much of a problem at all, that it can be easily controlled and eliminated by human technology. 



It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991 (Kaczynski), temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 13°F during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.

Albedo is a measure of the tendency of a surface to absorb and re-emit incoming radiation, and thus lower its own temperature. Its value ranges from 0% for an object that absorbs all radiation to 100% for an object that reflects all radiation. Every molecule of every substance has its own albedo, but albedo can also refer to a collection of very many objects, and can even be applied to objects of a very large scale, such as the planet Earth, which has an albedo of 38% (Walker, 1987).





Since albedo can greatly affect the temperature of an area, it is advantageous for people, especially in cold climates, to settle in areas where the albedo is very low, so that they can get as much warmth as possible from the sun. The reverse is true in desert and tropical climates; people want to live in areas where as much solar radiation as possible will be emitted back into space. According to the National Climatic Data Center’s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at Fairbanks, Alaska, is about 5°F warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of pine trees and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late winter months, when solar radiation is greater. To give another example, the entire nation of Belgium, which is among the most urbanized in the world, is considerably warmer than the mostly open, unforested French countryside that lies to its immediate southwest, perhaps also because of albedo effects.







Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of the earth, because more snow falls there, it is acually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When Brazilian ranchers cut down dark, tropical rainforest trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area increases by an average of about 5°F year-round (Kaczynski 1991). The difference would most likely be more than 30°F if the landscape of the rainforest was white instead of dark green. As evidence for this theory, scientists have climbed to the top of Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, which is located in an area well described as “steaming jungle”. But Kilimanjaro’s temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level. Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 81°F (this is the GHCN’s record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 2°F per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 41°F, which is much warmer than the approximately 20°F that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Loa, which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 40°F, despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.



But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is 14°F, which reduced to sea level at a rate of 2°F gives 42°F, which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 74°F, and it is during the dry season a dry 77°F, so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 2°F per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.



The only possible explanation is that on Kilimanjaro, a glacier built up when the climate was colder, and that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat to keep itself cold enough to not melt, and to keep the air temperature at the summit much lower than that atop Mauna Loa. This very wide gap in temperatures, of nearly 20°F, occurs despite the fact that the skies above both mountains are very cloudy and the climate of both is very wet, so not much solar radiation reaches either summit. If Mauna Loa were completely dry, it could be expected that its temperature would be even warmer, perhaps as warm as that of Tibet at 14,000 feet in summer.





Another good example of albedo in action is Greenland. Greenland is an island covered almost completely with ice. In the winter, very little sunlight reaches Greenland, so albedo is not as important. But in the summertime, it makes a very big difference, making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally be for a given latitude and elevation. For example, Eismitte is a weather station situated a bit south of the geographical center of the island (near 70°N) at an altitude of 9843 feet. The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70°N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 55°F. Given a lapse rate of 2°F per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 35°F. In fact, 2°F per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only 10°F, and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only 2°F. June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 2°F lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland’s ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 2°F per 1000 feet lapse rate.



Svalbard is a group of islands extending from about 75°N to 80°N in the very warmest part of the Arctic Ocean, the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as 19°F at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about –20°F but have fallen as low as –70°F. This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.





Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above. The temperature of the purest Arctic Ocean water is roughly 28°F at all depths, in all seasons (Rocky and Bullwinkle, 1970). The temperature of the ice above, however, is much colder because it reflects away some of the heat of the water below it. During the summertime, the upward face of the ice reflects away solar heat and prevents itself from melting completely. The ice that does melt helps keep the average July temperatures at the North Pole at about 31°F.







Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than if they wear white clothes. Ironically, dark skin also serves to aggravate heat loss during the hot summer months, although the human body’s blood circulation is much more powerful than the albedo effect of its skin. Thus children, much skinnier than adults, need more clothes in the wintertime to keep them warm, even if they are dark-skinned. 



However, it has often been speculated (Neunke 2000) that dark hair might serve the purpose of keeping people warm during extremely cold weather, since much heat escapes through the head. Dr. Matthew Neunke points out that in Russia, for example, the native peoples living furthest west, where the climate is warmer, have the lightest hair, whereas in the east they are all dark-haired. This theory has never been satisfactorily proven, however, because of the many other bodily processes that keep people warm. Also, it fails to explain why the majority of aboriginal people living in sunny and tropical climates have dark hair as well. According to Neunke’s theory, African aboriginal people should all be light-skinned, red-eyed, white-haired people, and Northern Europeans, who survived the Ice Ages, should be dark-skinned and swarthy. Dr. Neunke objects that blonde hair is an adaptation to camouflage in the snow (yellow snow, apparently), but at this point it is clear that he has no idea what he is talking about. Dr. Neunke is a respected authority on the subject of why white people are innocent little angels who are being outpopulated by big evil black people, but he has little knowledge of meteorology or medicine. It can safely be assumed that skin and hair color has little effect on a person’s internal body temperature. 







There is a simple relationship between the albedo of an area of the earth’s surface and its color. The lighter the color, the higher the albedo. A white substance would have an albedo of 1.00, or 100%, while a black substance would have an albedo of 0.00 or 0%. The human eye perceives green light especially well, so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think. For example, the albedo of a pine forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9% (Walker 1987), among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. The ocean, because it is so deep, is even lower, at about 3.5% (the surface temperature of the ocean at the equator is over 100°F (Kaczynski)). Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. All of these measurements were taken from Edward Walker’s study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45°N, but with different values for latitude and day, they would be different. The reason for this is not because of the amount of sunlight coming in, which does not change a substance’s albedo, but because the actual environments would be different in summer. For example, a cultivated field may come in as high as the low 20s, depending on the crop being cultivated. Because of increased photosynthesis, all of the values for the forests and swamp lands are nearly doubled in the summer. The grassy field, however, remains at 20% regardless of season or latitude. Near the equator, particularly in rainforest areas, the soil is very black, and its albedo is very close to 0. Some shallow lakes may have albedos as high as 45% during times when the sun is striking the lake from a very acute angle, and more of its light is reflected. Alpine areas often have strange albedo values because of the unusual land formations. 



Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 



Snow is the greatest source of albedo in the world, with an albedo that can be as high as 98% (Walker 1987). This is for the ideal example, however: deep snow over a treeless landscape with no obstacles around. In the real world, the maximum albedo depends on the environment. Thus, even in the middle of winter with a heavy snow cover, the albedo of weather stations in the pine-forested areas from Europe to Siberia and in the Americas rarely goes above 40%, and many stations in this area have averages around 25%. Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50’s in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world (Rocky and Bullwinkle).





Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that the earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 20°F colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place.



If the theory of global warming is true, and the polar regions of the planet are going to be rapidly warming up, then the magnitude and path of the warming trend will depend largely on the albedo of the earth’s polar regions, and to a lesser extent on the albedo of the whole planet. Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect (Kaczynski). But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo. If the ice were to melt, the very high-albedo ice would be replaced with some very low-albedo water, and temperatures would rise enormously, perhaps as much as 15°F, which would make the area warmer than any other area at that latitude. (This is what accounts for the unusually warm summers on the islands of Svalbard, in Norway. But Svalbard is surrounded by ocean, whereas the Davis Strait is surrounded by land, and thus has the potential to become even warmer than Svalbard.)



If the ice melted, then there would be a way for the warm waters of the Gulf Stream to penetrate deep into the Arctic, and warm spells would become increasingly frequent. This could accelerate the melting of the Arctic Ocean, a process which would feed on itself. A melted Arctic would help many people living in Arctic areas, but could possibly hurt many others living in other parts of the globe. 





In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old Soviet plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again. Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about 31°F (Rocky and Bullwinkle), and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 42°F.)





Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models such as the one at http://climate.gsfc.nasa.gov/~cahalan/FractalClouds/Movies have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about –240°F. This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 9°F temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, all we would need to do is increase the earth’s overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds.

Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.

This is for the ideal example, however: deep snow over a treeless landscape with no obstacles around. In the real world, the maximum albedo depends on the environment. Thus, even in the middle of winter with a heavy snow cover, the albedo of weather stations in the pine-forested areas from Europe to Siberia and in the Americas rarely goes above 40%, and many stations in this area have averages around 25%. Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50’s in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world (Rocky and Bullwinkle).





Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that the earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 20°F colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place.



If the theory of global warming is true, and the polar regions of the planet are going to be rapidly warming up, then the magnitude and path of the warming trend will depend largely on the albedo of the earth’s polar regions, and to a lesser extent on the albedo of the whole planet. Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect (Kaczynski). But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo. If the ice were to melt, the very high-albedo ice would be replaced with some very low-albedo water, and temperatures would rise enormously, perhaps as much as 15°F, which would make the area warmer than any other area at that latitude. (This is what accounts for the unusually warm summers on the islands of Svalbard, in Norway. But Svalbard is surrounded by ocean, whereas the Davis Strait is surrounded by land, and thus has the potential to become even warmer than Svalbard.)



If the ice melted, then there would be a way for the warm waters of the Gulf Stream to penetrate deep into the Arctic, and warm spells would become increasingly frequent. This could accelerate the melting of the Arctic Ocean, a process which would feed on itself. A melted Arctic would help many people living in Arctic areas, but could possibly hurt many others living in other parts of the globe. 





In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old Soviet plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again. Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about 31°F (Rocky and Bullwinkle), and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 42°F.)





Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models such as the one at http://climate.gsfc.nasa.gov/~cahalan/FractalClouds/Movies have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about –240°F. This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 9°F temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, all we would need to do is increase the earth’s overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 



Other scientists, noting the effect of volcanic eruptions on global temperatures, have suggested other ideas, some of which are actually practical, to stop global warming by increasing the earth’s albedo. While all of these solutions are expensive and would require cooperation from powerful nations, they show that the problem of global warming is not much of a problem at all, that it can be easily controlled and eliminated by human technology. 



It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991 (Kaczynski), temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 13°F during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Albedo''' is a measure of the tendency of a surface to absorb and re-emit incoming [[radiation]], and thus lower its own [[temperature]]. Its value ranges from 0% for an object that absorbs all radiation to 100% for an object that reflects all radiation. Every [[molecule]] of every substance has its own albedo, but albedo can also refer to a collection of very many objects, and can even be applied to objects of a very large scale, such as the planet [[Earth]], which has an albedo of 38% (Walker, 1987).





Since albedo can greatly affect the temperature of an area, it is advantageous for people, especially in cold climates, to settle in areas where the albedo is very low, so that they can get as much warmth as possible from the [[sun]]. The reverse is true in [[desert]] and [[tropic|tropical]] climates; people want to live in areas where as much solar radiation as possible will be emitted back into space. According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]’s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 5°F warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. To give another example, the entire nation of [[Belgium]], which is among the most urbanized in the world, is considerably warmer than the mostly open, unforested [[France|French]] countryside that lies to its immediate southwest, perhaps also because of albedo effects.



Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is acually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area increases by an average of about 5°F year-round (Kaczynski 1991). The difference would most likely be more than 30°F if the landscape of the rainforest was [[white]] instead of dark [[green]]. As evidence for this theory, scientists have climbed to the top of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in [[Tanzania]], which is located in an area well described as &quot;steaming jungle&quot;. But Kilimanjaro’s temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level. Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 81°F (this is the GHCN’s record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 2°F per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 41°F, which is much warmer than the approximately 20°F that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the [[Hawaii]]an [[volcano]] [[Mauna Loa]], which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 40°F, despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.



But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is 14°F, which reduced to sea level at a rate of 2°F gives 42°F, which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 74°F, and it is during the dry season a dry 77°F, so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 2°F per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.



The only possible explanation is that on Kilimanjaro, a glacier built up when the climate was colder, and that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat to keep itself cold enough to not melt, and to keep the air temperature at the summit much lower than that atop Mauna Loa. This very wide gap in temperatures, of nearly 20°F, occurs despite the fact that the skies above both mountains are very cloudy and the climate of both is very wet, so not much solar radiation reaches either summit. If Mauna Loa were completely dry, it could be expected that its temperature would be even warmer, perhaps as warm as that of Tibet at 14,000 feet in summer.





Another good example of albedo in action is Greenland. Greenland is an island covered almost completely with ice. In the winter, very little sunlight reaches Greenland, so albedo is not as important. But in the summertime, it makes a very big difference, making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally be for a given latitude and elevation. For example, Eismitte is a weather station situated a bit south of the geographical center of the island (near 70°N) at an altitude of 9843 feet. The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70°N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 55°F. Given a lapse rate of 2°F per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 35°F. In fact, 2°F per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only 10°F, and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only 2°F. June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 2°F lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland’s ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 2°F per 1000 feet lapse rate.



Svalbard is a group of islands extending from about 75°N to 80°N in the very warmest part of the Arctic Ocean, the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as 19°F at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about –20°F but have fallen as low as –70°F. This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.





Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above. The temperature of the purest Arctic Ocean water is roughly 28°F at all depths, in all seasons (Rocky and Bullwinkle, 1970). The temperature of the ice above, however, is much colder because it reflects away some of the heat of the water below it. During the summertime, the upward face of the ice reflects away solar heat and prevents itself from melting completely. The ice that does melt helps keep the average July temperatures at the North Pole at about 31°F.







Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than if they wear white clothes. Ironically, dark skin also serves to aggravate heat loss during the hot summer months, although the human body’s blood circulation is much more powerful than the albedo effect of its skin. Thus children, much skinnier than adults, need more clothes in the wintertime to keep them warm, even if they are dark-skinned. 









There is a simple relationship between the albedo of an area of the earth’s surface and its color. The lighter the color, the higher the albedo. A white substance would have an albedo of 1.00, or 100%, while a black substance would have an albedo of 0.00 or 0%. The human eye perceives green light especially well, so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think. For example, the albedo of a pine forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9% (Walker 1987), among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. The ocean, because it is so deep, is even lower, at about 3.5% (the surface temperature of the ocean at the equator is over 100°F (Kaczynski)). Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. All of these measurements were taken from Edward Walker’s study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45°N, but with different values for latitude and day, they would be different. The reason for this is not because of the amount of sunlight coming in, which does not change a substance’s albedo, but because the actual environments would be different in summer. For example, a cultivated field may come in as high as the low 20s, depending on the crop being cultivated. Because of increased photosynthesis, all of the values for the forests and swamp lands are nearly doubled in the summer. The grassy field, however, remains at 20% regardless of season or latitude. Near the equator, particularly in rainforest areas, the soil is very black, and its albedo is very close to 0. Some shallow lakes may have albedos as high as 45% during times when the sun is striking the lake from a very acute angle, and more of its light is reflected. Alpine areas often have strange albedo values because of the unusual land formations. 



Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 



Snow is the greatest source of albedo in the world, with an albedo that can be as high as 98% (Walker 1987). This is for the ideal example, however: deep snow over a treeless landscape with no obstacles around. In the real world, the maximum albedo depends on the environment. Thus, even in the middle of winter with a heavy snow cover, the albedo of weather stations in the pine-forested areas from Europe to Siberia and in the Americas rarely goes above 40%, and many stations in this area have averages around 25%. Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50’s in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world (Rocky and Bullwinkle).





Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that the earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 20°F colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place.



If the theory of global warming is true, and the polar regions of the planet are going to be rapidly warming up, then the magnitude and path of the warming trend will depend largely on the albedo of the earth’s polar regions, and to a lesser extent on the albedo of the whole planet. Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect (Kaczynski). But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo. If the ice were to melt, the very high-albedo ice would be replaced with some very low-albedo water, and temperatures would rise enormously, perhaps as much as 15°F, which would make the area warmer than any other area at that latitude.

The difference would most likely be more than 30&amp;deg;F if the landscape of the rainforest was [[white]] instead of dark [[green]]. As evidence for this theory, scientists have climbed to the top of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in [[Tanzania]], which is located in an area well described as &quot;steaming jungle&quot;. But Kilimanjaro’s temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level. Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 81&amp;deg;F (this is the GHCN’s record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 2&amp;deg;F per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 41&amp;deg;F, which is much warmer than the approximately 20&amp;deg;F that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the [[Hawaii]]an [[volcano]] [[Mauna Loa]], which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 40&amp;deg;F, despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.

But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is 14&amp;deg;F, which reduced to sea level at a rate of 2&amp;deg;F gives 42&amp;deg;F, which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 74&amp;deg;F, and it is during the dry season a dry 77&amp;deg;F, so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.

The only possible explanation is that on Kilimanjaro, a glacier built up when the climate was colder, and that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat to keep itself cold enough to not melt, and to keep the air temperature at the summit much lower than that atop Mauna Loa. This very wide gap in temperatures, of nearly 20&amp;deg;F, occurs despite the fact that the skies above both mountains are very cloudy and the climate of both is very wet, so not much solar radiation reaches either summit. If Mauna Loa were completely dry, it could be expected that its temperature would be even warmer, perhaps as warm as that of Tibet at 14,000 feet in summer.

But in the summertime, it makes a very big difference, making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally be for a given latitude and elevation. For example, Eismitte is a weather station situated a bit south of the geographical center of the island (near 70&amp;deg;N) at an altitude of 9843 feet. The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70&amp;deg;N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 55&amp;deg;F. Given a lapse rate of 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 35&amp;deg;F. In fact, 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only 10&amp;deg;F, and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only 2&amp;deg;F. June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 2&amp;deg;F lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland’s ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet lapse rate.

Svalbard is a group of islands extending from about 75&amp;deg;N to 80&amp;deg;N in the very warmest part of the Arctic Ocean, the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as 19&amp;deg;F at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about –20&amp;deg;F but have fallen as low as –70&amp;deg;F. This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.


Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above. The temperature of the purest Arctic Ocean water is roughly 28&amp;deg;F at all depths, in all seasons (Rocky and Bullwinkle, 1970). The temperature of the ice above, however, is much colder because it reflects away some of the heat of the water below it. During the summertime, the upward face of the ice reflects away solar heat and prevents itself from melting completely. The ice that does melt helps keep the average July temperatures at the North Pole at about 31&amp;deg;F.



Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than if they wear white clothes. Ironically, dark skin also serves to aggravate heat loss during the hot summer months, although the human body’s blood circulation is much more powerful than the albedo effect of its skin. Thus children, much skinnier than adults, need more clothes in the wintertime to keep them warm, even if they are dark-skinned. 




There is a simple relationship between the albedo of an area of the earth’s surface and its color. The lighter the color, the higher the albedo. A white substance would have an albedo of 1.00, or 100%, while a black substance would have an albedo of 0.00 or 0%. The human eye perceives green light especially well, so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think. For example, the albedo of a pine forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9% (Walker 1987), among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. The ocean, because it is so deep, is even lower, at about 3.5% (the surface temperature of the ocean at the equator is over 100&amp;deg;F (Kaczynski)). Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. All of these measurements were taken from Edward Walker’s study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N, but with different values for latitude and day, they would be different. The reason for this is not because of the amount of sunlight coming in, which does not change a substance’s albedo, but because the actual environments would be different in summer. For example, a cultivated field may come in as high as the low 20s, depending on the crop being cultivated. Because of increased photosynthesis, all of the values for the forests and swamp lands are nearly doubled in the summer. The grassy field, however, remains at 20% regardless of season or latitude. Near the equator, particularly in rainforest areas, the soil is very black, and its albedo is very close to 0. Some shallow lakes may have albedos as high as 45% during times when the sun is striking the lake from a very acute angle, and more of its light is reflected. Alpine areas often have strange albedo values because of the unusual land formations. 

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 

Snow is the greatest source of albedo in the world, with an albedo that can be as high as 98% (Walker 1987). This is for the ideal example, however: deep snow over a treeless landscape with no obstacles around. In the real world, the maximum albedo depends on the environment. Thus, even in the middle of winter with a heavy snow cover, the albedo of weather stations in the pine-forested areas from Europe to Siberia and in the Americas rarely goes above 40%, and many stations in this area have averages around 25%. Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50’s in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world (Rocky and Bullwinkle).


Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that the earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 20&amp;deg;F colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place.

If the theory of global warming is true, and the polar regions of the planet are going to be rapidly warming up, then the magnitude and path of the warming trend will depend largely on the albedo of the earth’s polar regions, and to a lesser extent on the albedo of the whole planet. Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect (Kaczynski). But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo. If the ice were to melt, the very high-albedo ice would be replaced with some very low-albedo water, and temperatures would rise enormously, perhaps as much as 15&amp;deg;F, which would make the area warmer than any other area at that latitude. (This is what accounts for the unusually warm summers on the islands of Svalbard, in Norway. But Svalbard is surrounded by ocean, whereas the Davis Strait is surrounded by land, and thus has the potential to become even warmer than Svalbard.)

If the ice melted, then there would be a way for the warm waters of the Gulf Stream to penetrate deep into the Arctic, and warm spells would become increasingly frequent. This could accelerate the melting of the Arctic Ocean, a process which would feed on itself. A melted Arctic would help many people living in Arctic areas, but could possibly hurt many others living in other parts of the globe. 


In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old Soviet plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again. Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about 31&amp;deg;F (Rocky and Bullwinkle), and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 42&amp;deg;F.)


Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models such as the one at http://climate.gsfc.nasa.gov/~cahalan/FractalClouds/Movies have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about –240&amp;deg;F. This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 9&amp;deg;F temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, all we would need to do is increase the earth’s overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

Other scientists, noting the effect of volcanic eruptions on global temperatures, have suggested other ideas, some of which are actually practical, to stop global warming by increasing the earth’s albedo. While all of these solutions are expensive and would require cooperation from powerful nations, they show that the problem of global warming is not much of a problem at all, that it can be easily controlled and eliminated by human technology. 

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991 (Kaczynski), temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 13&amp;deg;F during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Albedo''' is a measure of the tendency of a surface to absorb and re-emit incoming [[radiation]], and thus lower its own [[temperature]]. Its value ranges from 0% for an object that absorbs all radiation to 100% for an object that reflects all radiation. Every [[molecule]] of every substance has its own albedo, but albedo can also refer to a collection of very many objects, and can even be applied to objects of a very large scale, such as the planet [[Earth]], which has an albedo of 38% (Walker, 1987).


Since albedo can greatly affect the temperature of an area, it is advantageous for people, especially in cold climates, to settle in areas where the albedo is very low, so that they can get as much warmth as possible from the [[sun]]. The reverse is true in [[desert]] and [[tropic|tropical]] climates; people want to live in areas where as much solar radiation as possible will be emitted back into space. According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]’s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 5&amp;deg;F warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. To give another example, the entire nation of [[Belgium]], which is among the most urbanized in the world, is considerably warmer than the mostly open, unforested [[France|French]] countryside that lies to its immediate southwest, perhaps also because of albedo effects.

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is acually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area increases by an average of about 5&amp;deg;F year-round (Kaczynski 1991). The difference would most likely be more than 30&amp;deg;F if the landscape of the rainforest was [[white]] instead of dark [[green]]. As evidence for this theory, scientists have climbed to the top of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in [[Tanzania]], which is located in an area well described as &quot;steaming jungle&quot;. But Kilimanjaro’s temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level. Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 81&amp;deg;F (this is the GHCN’s record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 2&amp;deg;F per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 41&amp;deg;F, which is much warmer than the approximately 20&amp;deg;F that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the [[Hawaii]]an [[volcano]] [[Mauna Loa]], which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 40&amp;deg;F, despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.

But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is 14&amp;deg;F, which reduced to sea level at a rate of 2&amp;deg;F gives 42&amp;deg;F, which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 74&amp;deg;F, and it is during the dry season a dry 77&amp;deg;F, so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.

The only possible explanation is that on Kilimanjaro, a glacier built up when the climate was colder, and that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat to keep itself cold enough to not melt, and to keep the air temperature at the summit much lower than that atop Mauna Loa. This very wide gap in temperatures, of nearly 20&amp;deg;F, occurs despite the fact that the skies above both mountains are very cloudy and the climate of both is very wet, so not much solar radiation reaches either summit. If Mauna Loa were completely dry, it could be expected that its temperature would be even warmer, perhaps as warm as that of Tibet at 14,000 feet in summer.


Another good example of albedo in action is Greenland. Greenland is an island covered almost completely with ice. In the winter, very little sunlight reaches Greenland, so albedo is not as important. But in the summertime, it makes a very big difference, making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally be for a given latitude and elevation. For example, Eismitte is a weather station situated a bit south of the geographical center of the island (near 70&amp;deg;N) at an altitude of 9843 feet. The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70&amp;deg;N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 55&amp;deg;F. Given a lapse rate of 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 35&amp;deg;F. In fact, 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only 10&amp;deg;F, and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only 2&amp;deg;F. June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 2&amp;deg;F lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland’s ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet lapse rate.

Svalbard is a group of islands extending from about 75&amp;deg;N to 80&amp;deg;N in the very warmest part of the Arctic Ocean, the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as 19&amp;deg;F at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about –20&amp;deg;F but have fallen as low as –70&amp;deg;F. This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.


Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above. The temperature of the purest Arctic Ocean water is roughly 28&amp;deg;F at all depths, in all seasons (Rocky and Bullwinkle, 1970). The temperature of the ice above, however, is much colder because it reflects away some of the heat of the water below it. During the summertime, the upward face of the ice reflects away solar heat and prevents itself from melting completely. The ice that does melt helps keep the average July temperatures at the North Pole at about 31&amp;deg;F.



Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than if they wear white clothes. Ironically, dark skin also serves to aggravate heat loss during the hot summer months, although the human body’s blood circulation is much more powerful than the albedo effect of its skin.

But Kilimanjaro&amp;#8217;s temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level. Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 81&amp;deg;F (this is the GHCN&amp;#8217;s record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 2&amp;deg;F per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 41&amp;deg;F, which is much warmer than the approximately 20&amp;deg;F that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the [[Hawaii]]an [[volcano]] [[Mauna Loa]], which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 40&amp;deg;F, despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.

But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is 14&amp;deg;F, which reduced to sea level at a rate of 2&amp;deg;F gives 42&amp;deg;F, which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 74&amp;deg;F, and it is during the dry season a dry 77&amp;deg;F, so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.

The only possible explanation is that on Kilimanjaro, a glacier built up when the climate was colder, and that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat to keep itself cold enough to not melt, and to keep the air temperature at the summit much lower than that atop Mauna Loa. This very wide gap in temperatures, of nearly 20&amp;deg;F, occurs despite the fact that the skies above both mountains are very cloudy and the climate of both is very wet, so not much solar radiation reaches either summit. If Mauna Loa were completely dry, it could be expected that its temperature would be even warmer, perhaps as warm as that of Tibet at 14,000 feet in summer.


Another good example of albedo in action is Greenland. Greenland is an island covered almost completely with ice. In the winter, very little sunlight reaches Greenland, so albedo is not as important. But in the summertime, it makes a very big difference, making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally be for a given latitude and elevation. For example, Eismitte is a weather station situated a bit south of the geographical center of the island (near 70&amp;deg;N) at an altitude of 9843 feet. The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70&amp;deg;N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 55&amp;deg;F. Given a lapse rate of 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 35&amp;deg;F. In fact, 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only 10&amp;deg;F, and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only 2&amp;deg;F. June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 2&amp;deg;F lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland&amp;#8217;s ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet lapse rate.

Svalbard is a group of islands extending from about 75&amp;deg;N to 80&amp;deg;N in the very warmest part of the Arctic Ocean, the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as 19&amp;deg;F at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about &amp;#8211;20&amp;deg;F but have fallen as low as &amp;#8211;70&amp;deg;F. This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.


Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above. The temperature of the purest Arctic Ocean water is roughly 28&amp;deg;F at all depths, in all seasons (Rocky and Bullwinkle, 1970). The temperature of the ice above, however, is much colder because it reflects away some of the heat of the water below it. During the summertime, the upward face of the ice reflects away solar heat and prevents itself from melting completely. The ice that does melt helps keep the average July temperatures at the North Pole at about 31&amp;deg;F.



Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than if they wear white clothes. Ironically, dark skin also serves to aggravate heat loss during the hot summer months, although the human body&amp;#8217;s blood circulation is much more powerful than the albedo effect of its skin. Thus children, much skinnier than adults, need more clothes in the wintertime to keep them warm, even if they are dark-skinned. 




There is a simple relationship between the albedo of an area of the earth&amp;#8217;s surface and its color. The lighter the color, the higher the albedo. A white substance would have an albedo of 1.00, or 100%, while a black substance would have an albedo of 0.00 or 0%. The human eye perceives green light especially well, so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think. For example, the albedo of a pine forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9% (Walker 1987), among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. The ocean, because it is so deep, is even lower, at about 3.5% (the surface temperature of the ocean at the equator is allegedly over 100&amp;deg;F). Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. All of these measurements were taken from Edward Walker&amp;#8217;s study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N, but with different values for latitude and day, they would be different. The reason for this is not because of the amount of sunlight coming in, which does not change a substance&amp;#8217;s albedo, but because the actual environments would be different in summer. For example, a cultivated field may come in as high as the low 20s, depending on the crop being cultivated. Because of increased photosynthesis, all of the values for the forests and swamp lands are nearly doubled in the summer. The grassy field, however, remains at 20% regardless of season or latitude. Near the equator, particularly in rainforest areas, the soil is very black, and its albedo is very close to 0. Some shallow lakes may have albedos as high as 45% during times when the sun is striking the lake from a very acute angle, and more of its light is reflected. Alpine areas often have strange albedo values because of the unusual land formations. 

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 

Snow is the greatest source of albedo in the world, with an albedo that can be as high as 98% (Walker 1987). This is for the ideal example, however: deep snow over a treeless landscape with no obstacles around. In the real world, the maximum albedo depends on the environment. Thus, even in the middle of winter with a heavy snow cover, the albedo of weather stations in the pine-forested areas from Europe to Siberia and in the Americas rarely goes above 40%, and many stations in this area have averages around 25%. Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50&amp;#8217;s in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world (Rocky and Bullwinkle).


Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that the earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 20&amp;deg;F colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place.

If the theory of global warming is true, and the polar regions of the planet are going to be rapidly warming up, then the magnitude and path of the warming trend will depend largely on the albedo of the earth&amp;#8217;s polar regions, and to a lesser extent on the albedo of the whole planet. Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect. But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo. If the ice were to melt, the very high-albedo ice would be replaced with some very low-albedo water, and temperatures would rise enormously, perhaps as much as 15&amp;deg;F, which would make the area warmer than any other area at that latitude. (This is what accounts for the unusually warm summers on the islands of Svalbard, in Norway. But Svalbard is surrounded by ocean, whereas the Davis Strait is surrounded by land, and thus has the potential to become even warmer than Svalbard.)

If the ice melted, then there would be a way for the warm waters of the Gulf Stream to penetrate deep into the Arctic, and warm spells would become increasingly frequent. This could accelerate the melting of the Arctic Ocean, a process which would feed on itself. A melted Arctic would help many people living in Arctic areas, but could possibly hurt many others living in other parts of the globe. 


In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old Soviet plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again. Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about 31&amp;deg;F (Rocky and Bullwinkle), and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 42&amp;deg;F.)


Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models such as the one at http://climate.gsfc.nasa.gov/~cahalan/FractalClouds/Movies have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about &amp;#8211;240&amp;deg;F. This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 9&amp;deg;F temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, all we would need to do is increase the earth&amp;#8217;s overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

Other scientists, noting the effect of volcanic eruptions on global temperatures, have suggested other ideas, some of which are actually practical, to stop global warming by increasing the earth&amp;#8217;s albedo. While all of these solutions are expensive and would require cooperation from powerful nations, they show that the problem of global warming is not much of a problem at all, that it can be easily controlled and eliminated by human technology. 

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 13&amp;deg;F during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Albedo''' is a measure of the tendency of a surface to absorb and re-emit incoming [[radiation]], and thus lower its own [[temperature]]. Its value ranges from 0% for an object that absorbs all radiation to 100% for an object that reflects all radiation. Every [[molecule]] of every substance has its own albedo, but albedo can also refer to a collection of very many objects, and can even be applied to objects of a very large scale, such as the planet [[Earth]], which has an albedo of 38% (Walker, 1987).


Since albedo can greatly affect the temperature of an area, it is advantageous for people, especially in cold climates, to settle in areas where the albedo is very low, so that they can get as much warmth as possible from the [[sun]]. The reverse is true in [[desert]] and [[tropic|tropical]] climates; people want to live in areas where as much solar radiation as possible will be emitted back into space. According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]&amp;#8217;s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 5&amp;deg;F warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. To give another example, the entire nation of [[Belgium]], which is among the most urbanized in the world, is considerably warmer than the mostly open, unforested [[France|French]] countryside that lies to its immediate southwest, perhaps also because of albedo effects.

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is acually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 5&amp;deg;F year-round. The difference would most likely be more than 30&amp;deg;F if the landscape of the rainforest was [[white]] instead of dark [[green]]. As evidence for this theory, scientists have climbed to the top of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in [[Tanzania]], which is located in an area well described as &quot;steaming jungle&quot;. But Kilimanjaro&amp;#8217;s temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level. Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 81&amp;deg;F (this is the GHCN&amp;#8217;s record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 2&amp;deg;F per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 41&amp;deg;F, which is much warmer than the approximately 20&amp;deg;F that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the [[Hawaii]]an [[volcano]] [[Mauna Loa]], which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 40&amp;deg;F, despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.

But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is 14&amp;deg;F, which reduced to sea level at a rate of 2&amp;deg;F gives 42&amp;deg;F, which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 74&amp;deg;F, and it is during the dry season a dry 77&amp;deg;F, so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.

The only possible explanation is that on Kilimanjaro, a glacier built up when the climate was colder, and that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat to keep itself cold enough to not melt, and to keep the air temperature at the summit much lower than that atop Mauna Loa. This very wide gap in temperatures, of nearly 20&amp;deg;F, occurs despite the fact that the skies above both mountains are very cloudy and the climate of both is very wet, so not much solar radiation reaches either summit. If Mauna Loa were completely dry, it could be expected that its temperature would be even warmer, perhaps as warm as that of Tibet at 14,000 feet in summer.


Another good example of albedo in action is Greenland. Greenland is an island covered almost completely with ice. In the winter, very little sunlight reaches Greenland, so albedo is not as important. But in the summertime, it makes a very big difference, making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally be for a given latitude and elevation. For example, Eismitte is a weather station situated a bit south of the geographical center of the island (near 70&amp;deg;N) at an altitude of 9843 feet. The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70&amp;deg;N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 55&amp;deg;F. Given a lapse rate of 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 35&amp;deg;F. In fact, 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only 10&amp;deg;F, and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only 2&amp;deg;F. June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 2&amp;deg;F lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland&amp;#8217;s ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet lapse rate.

Svalbard is a group of islands extending from about 75&amp;deg;N to 80&amp;deg;N in the very warmest part of the Arctic Ocean, the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as 19&amp;deg;F at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about &amp;#8211;20&amp;deg;F but have fallen as low as &amp;#8211;70&amp;deg;F. This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.


Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above. The temperature of the purest Arctic Ocean water is roughly 28&amp;deg;F at all depths, in all seasons (Rocky and Bullwinkle, 1970). The temperature of the ice above, however, is much colder because it reflects away some of the heat of the water below it. During the summertime, the upward face of the ice reflects away solar heat and prevents itself from melting completely. The ice that does melt helps keep the average July temperatures at the North Pole at about 31&amp;deg;F.



Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than if they wear white clothes. Ironically, dark skin also serves to aggravate heat loss during the hot summer months, although the human body&amp;#8217;s blood circulation is much more powerful than the albedo effect of its skin. Thus children, much skinnier than adults, need more clothes in the wintertime to keep them warm, even if they are dark-skinned. 




There is a simple relationship between the albedo of an area of the earth&amp;#8217;s surface and its color. The lighter the color, the higher the albedo. A white substance would have an albedo of 1.00, or 100%, while a black substance would have an albedo of 0.00 or 0%. The human eye perceives green light especially well, so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think. For example, the albedo of a pine forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9% (Walker 1987), among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. The ocean, because it is so deep, is even lower, at about 3.5% (the surface temperature of the ocean at the equator is allegedly over 100&amp;deg;F). Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. All of these measurements were taken from Edward Walker&amp;#8217;s study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N, but with different values for latitude and day, they would be different. The reason for this is not because of the amount of sunlight coming in, which does not change a substance&amp;#8217;s albedo, but because the actual environments would be different in summer. For example, a cultivated field may come in as high as the low 20s, depending on the crop being cultivated. Because of increased photosynthesis, all of the values for the forests and swamp lands are nearly doubled in the summer. The grassy field, however, remains at 20% regardless of season or latitude. Near the equator, particularly in rainforest areas, the soil is very black, and its albedo is very close to 0. Some shallow lakes may have albedos as high as 45% during times when the sun is striking the lake from a very acute angle, and more of its light is reflected. Alpine areas often have strange albedo values because of the unusual land formations. 

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 

Snow is the greatest source of albedo in the world, with an albedo that can be as high as 98% (Walker 1987). This is for the ideal example, however: deep snow over a treeless landscape with no obstacles around. In the real world, the maximum albedo depends on the environment. Thus, even in the middle of winter with a heavy snow cover, the albedo of weather stations in the pine-forested areas from Europe to Siberia and in the Americas rarely goes above 40%, and many stations in this area have averages around 25%. Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50&amp;#8217;s in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world (Rocky and Bullwinkle).


Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that the earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 20&amp;deg;F colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place.

If the theory of global warming is true, and the polar regions of the planet are going to be rapidly warming up, then the magnitude and path of the warming trend will depend largely on the albedo of the earth&amp;#8217;s polar regions, and to a lesser extent on the albedo of the whole planet. Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect. But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo. If the ice were to melt, the very high-albedo ice would be replaced with some very low-albedo water, and temperatures would rise enormously, perhaps as much as 15&amp;deg;F, which would make the area warmer than any other area at that latitude. (This is what accounts for the unusually warm summers on the islands of Svalbard, in Norway. But Svalbard is surrounded by ocean, whereas the Davis Strait is surrounded by land, and thus has the potential to become even warmer than Svalbard.)

If the ice melted, then there would be a way for the warm waters of the Gulf Stream to penetrate deep into the Arctic, and warm spells would become increasingly frequent. This could accelerate the melting of the Arctic Ocean, a process which would feed on itself. A melted Arctic would help many people living in Arctic areas, but could possibly hurt many others living in other parts of the globe. 


In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old Soviet plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again. Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about 31&amp;deg;F (Rocky and Bullwinkle), and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 42&amp;deg;F.)


Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models such as the one at http://climate.gsfc.nasa.gov/~cahalan/FractalClouds/Movies have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about &amp;#8211;240&amp;deg;F. This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 9&amp;deg;F temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, all we would need to do is increase the earth&amp;#8217;s overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

Other scientists, noting the effect of volcanic eruptions on global temperatures, have suggested other ideas, some of which are actually practical, to stop global warming by increasing the earth&amp;#8217;s albedo. While all of these solutions are expensive and would require cooperation from powerful nations, they show that the problem of global warming is not much of a problem at all, that it can be easily controlled and eliminated by human technology. 

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 13&amp;deg;F during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Albedo''' is a measure of the tendency of a surface to absorb and re-emit incoming [[radiation]], and thus lower its own [[temperature]]. Its value ranges from 0% for an object that absorbs all radiation to 100% for an object that reflects all radiation. Every [[molecule]] of every substance has its own albedo, but albedo can also refer to a collection of very many objects, and can even be applied to objects of a very large scale, such as the planet [[Earth]], which has an albedo of 38% (Walker, 1987).


Since albedo can greatly affect the temperature of an area, it is advantageous for people, especially in cold climates, to settle in areas where the albedo is very low, so that they can get as much warmth as possible from the [[sun]]. The reverse is true in [[desert]] and [[tropic|tropical]] climates; people want to live in areas where as much solar radiation as possible will be emitted back into space. According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]&amp;#8217;s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 5&amp;deg;F warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. To give another example, the entire nation of [[Belgium]], which is among the most urbanized in the world, is considerably warmer than the mostly open, unforested [[France|French]] countryside that lies to its immediate southwest, perhaps also because of albedo effects.

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is acually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 5&amp;deg;F year-round. The difference would most likely be more than 30&amp;deg;F if the landscape of the rainforest was [[white]] instead of dark [[green]]. As evidence for this theory, scientists have climbed to the top of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in [[Tanzania]], which is located in an area well described as &quot;steaming jungle&quot;. But Kilimanjaro&amp;#8217;s temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level. Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 81&amp;deg;F (this is the GHCN&amp;#8217;s record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 2&amp;deg;F per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 41&amp;deg;F, which is much warmer than the approximately 20&amp;deg;F that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the [[Hawaii]]an [[volcano]] [[Mauna Loa]], which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 40&amp;deg;F, despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.

But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is 14&amp;deg;F, which reduced to sea level at a rate of 2&amp;deg;F gives 42&amp;deg;F, which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 74&amp;deg;F, and it is during the dry season a dry 77&amp;deg;F, so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.

The only possible explanation is that on Kilimanjaro, a glacier built up when the climate was colder, and that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat to keep itself cold enough to not melt, and to keep the air temperature at the summit much lower than that atop Mauna Loa. This very wide gap in temperatures, of nearly 20&amp;deg;F, occurs despite the fact that the skies above both mountains are very cloudy and the climate of both is very wet, so not much solar radiation reaches either summit. If Mauna Loa were completely dry, it could be expected that its temperature would be even warmer, perhaps as warm as that of Tibet at 14,000 feet in summer.


Another good example of albedo in action is Greenland. Greenland is an island covered almost completely with ice. In the winter, very little sunlight reaches Greenland, so albedo is not as important. But in the summertime, it makes a very big difference, making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally be for a given latitude and elevation. For example, Eismitte is a weather station situated a bit south of the geographical center of the island (near 70&amp;deg;N) at an altitude of 9843 feet. The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70&amp;deg;N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 55&amp;deg;F. Given a lapse rate of 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 35&amp;deg;F. In fact, 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only 10&amp;deg;F, and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only 2&amp;deg;F. June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 2&amp;deg;F lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland&amp;#8217;s ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet lapse rate.

Svalbard is a group of islands extending from about 75&amp;deg;N to 80&amp;deg;N in the very warmest part of the Arctic Ocean, the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as 19&amp;deg;F at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about &amp;#8211;20&amp;deg;F but have fallen as low as &amp;#8211;70&amp;deg;F. This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.


Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above. The temperature of the purest Arctic Ocean water is roughly 28&amp;deg;F at all depths, in all seasons (Rocky and Bullwinkle, 1970). The temperature of the ice above, however, is much colder because it reflects away some of the heat of the water below it. During the summertime, the upward face of the ice reflects away solar heat and prevents itself from melting completely. The ice that does melt helps keep the average July temperatures at the North Pole at about 31&amp;deg;F.



Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than if they wear white clothes. Ironically, dark skin also serves to aggravate heat loss during the hot summer months, although the human body&amp;#8217;s blood circulation is much more powerful than the albedo effect of its skin. Thus children, much skinnier than adults, need more clothes in the wintertime to keep them warm, even if they are dark-skinned. 




There is a simple relationship between the albedo of an area of the earth&amp;#8217;s surface and its color. The lighter the color, the higher the albedo. A white substance would have an albedo of 1.00, or 100%, while a black substance would have an albedo of 0.00 or 0%. The human eye perceives green light especially well, so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think. For example, the albedo of a pine forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9% (Walker 1987), among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. The ocean, because it is so deep, is even lower, at about 3.5% (the surface temperature of the ocean at the equator is allegedly over 100&amp;deg;F). Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. All of these measurements were taken from Edward Walker&amp;#8217;s study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N, but with different values for latitude and day, they would be different. The reason for this is not because of the amount of sunlight coming in, which does not change a substance&amp;#8217;s albedo, but because the actual environments would be different in summer. For example, a cultivated field may come in as high as the low 20s, depending on the crop being cultivated. Because of increased photosynthesis, all of the values for the forests and swamp lands are nearly doubled in the summer. The grassy field, however, remains at 20% regardless of season or latitude. Near the equator, particularly in rainforest areas, the soil is very black, and its albedo is very close to 0. Some shallow lakes may have albedos as high as 45% during times when the sun is striking the lake from a very acute angle, and more of its light is reflected. Alpine areas often have strange albedo values because of the unusual land formations. 

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 

Snow is the greatest source of albedo in the world, with an albedo that can be as high as 98% (Walker 1987). This is for the ideal example, however: deep snow over a treeless landscape with no obstacles around. In the real world, the maximum albedo depends on the environment. Thus, even in the middle of winter with a heavy snow cover, the albedo of weather stations in the pine-forested areas from Europe to Siberia and in the Americas rarely goes above 40%, and many stations in this area have averages around 25%. Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50&amp;#8217;s in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world (Rocky and Bullwinkle).


Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that the earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 20&amp;deg;F colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place.

If the theory of global warming is true, and the polar regions of the planet are going to be rapidly warming up, then the magnitude and path of the warming trend will depend largely on the albedo of the earth&amp;#8217;s polar regions, and to a lesser extent on the albedo of the whole planet. Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect. But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo. If the ice were to melt, the very high-albedo ice would be replaced with some very low-albedo water, and temperatures would rise enormously, perhaps as much as 15&amp;deg;F, which would make the area warmer than any other area at that latitude. (This is what accounts for the unusually warm summers on the islands of Svalbard, in Norway. But Svalbard is surrounded by ocean, whereas the Davis Strait is surrounded by land, and thus has the potential to become even warmer than Svalbard.)

If the ice melted, then there would be a way for the warm waters of the Gulf Stream to penetrate deep into the Arctic, and warm spells would become increasingly frequent. This could accelerate the melting of the Arctic Ocean, a process which would feed on itself. A melted Arctic would help many people living in Arctic areas, but could possibly hurt many others living in other parts of the globe. 


In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old Soviet plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again. Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about 31&amp;deg;F (Rocky and Bullwinkle), and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 42&amp;deg;F.)


Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models such as the one at http://climate.gsfc.nasa.gov/~cahalan/FractalClouds/Movies have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about &amp;#8211;240&amp;deg;F. This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 9&amp;deg;F temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, all we would need to do is increase the earth&amp;#8217;s overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

Other scientists, noting the effect of volcanic eruptions on global temperatures, have suggested other ideas, some of which are actually practical, to stop global warming by increasing the earth&amp;#8217;s albedo. While all of these solutions are expensive and would require cooperation from powerful nations, they show that the problem of global warming is not much of a problem at all, that it can be easily controlled and eliminated by human technology. 

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 13&amp;deg;F during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.

Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50&amp;#8217;s in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world.


Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that the earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 20&amp;deg;F colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place.

If the theory of global warming is true, and the polar regions of the planet are going to be rapidly warming up, then the magnitude and path of the warming trend will depend largely on the albedo of the earth&amp;#8217;s polar regions, and to a lesser extent on the albedo of the whole planet. Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect. But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo. If the ice were to melt, the very high-albedo ice would be replaced with some very low-albedo water, and temperatures would rise enormously, perhaps as much as 15&amp;deg;F, which would make the area warmer than any other area at that latitude. (This is what accounts for the unusually warm summers on the islands of Svalbard, in Norway. But Svalbard is surrounded by ocean, whereas the Davis Strait is surrounded by land, and thus has the potential to become even warmer than Svalbard.)

If the ice melted, then there would be a way for the warm waters of the Gulf Stream to penetrate deep into the Arctic, and warm spells would become increasingly frequent. This could accelerate the melting of the Arctic Ocean, a process which would feed on itself. A melted Arctic would help many people living in Arctic areas, but could possibly hurt many others living in other parts of the globe. 


In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old Soviet plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again. Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about 31&amp;deg;F, and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 42&amp;deg;F.)


Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models such as the one at http://climate.gsfc.nasa.gov/~cahalan/FractalClouds/Movies have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about &amp;#8211;240&amp;deg;F. This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 9&amp;deg;F temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, all we would need to do is increase the earth&amp;#8217;s overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

Other scientists, noting the effect of volcanic eruptions on global temperatures, have suggested other ideas, some of which are actually practical, to stop global warming by increasing the earth&amp;#8217;s albedo. While all of these solutions are expensive and would require cooperation from powerful nations, they show that the problem of global warming is not much of a problem at all, that it can be easily controlled and eliminated by human technology. 

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 13&amp;deg;F during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Albedo''' is a measure of the tendency of a surface to absorb and re-emit incoming [[radiation]], and thus lower its own [[temperature]]. Its value ranges from 0% for an object that absorbs all radiation to 100% for an object that reflects all radiation. Every [[molecule]] of every substance has its own albedo, but albedo can also refer to a collection of very many objects, and can even be applied to objects of a very large scale, such as the planet [[Earth]], which has an albedo of 38%.


Since albedo can greatly affect the temperature of an area, it is advantageous for people, especially in cold climates, to settle in areas where the albedo is very low, so that they can get as much warmth as possible from the [[sun]]. The reverse is true in [[desert]] and [[tropic|tropical]] climates; people want to live in areas where as much solar radiation as possible will be emitted back into space. According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]&amp;#8217;s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 5&amp;deg;F warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. To give another example, the entire nation of [[Belgium]], which is among the most urbanized in the world, is considerably warmer than the mostly open, unforested [[France|French]] countryside that lies to its immediate southwest, perhaps also because of albedo effects.

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is acually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 5&amp;deg;F year-round. The difference would most likely be more than 30&amp;deg;F if the landscape of the rainforest was [[white]] instead of dark [[green]]. As evidence for this theory, scientists have climbed to the top of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in [[Tanzania]], which is located in an area well described as &quot;steaming jungle&quot;. But Kilimanjaro&amp;#8217;s temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level. Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 81&amp;deg;F (this is the GHCN&amp;#8217;s record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 2&amp;deg;F per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 41&amp;deg;F, which is much warmer than the approximately 20&amp;deg;F that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the [[Hawaii]]an [[volcano]] [[Mauna Loa]], which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 40&amp;deg;F, despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.

But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is 14&amp;deg;F, which reduced to sea level at a rate of 2&amp;deg;F gives 42&amp;deg;F, which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 74&amp;deg;F, and it is during the dry season a dry 77&amp;deg;F, so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.

The only possible explanation is that on Kilimanjaro, a glacier built up when the climate was colder, and that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat to keep itself cold enough to not melt, and to keep the air temperature at the summit much lower than that atop Mauna Loa. This very wide gap in temperatures, of nearly 20&amp;deg;F, occurs despite the fact that the skies above both mountains are very cloudy and the climate of both is very wet, so not much solar radiation reaches either summit. If Mauna Loa were completely dry, it could be expected that its temperature would be even warmer, perhaps as warm as that of Tibet at 14,000 feet in summer.


Another good example of albedo in action is Greenland. Greenland is an island covered almost completely with ice. In the winter, very little sunlight reaches Greenland, so albedo is not as important. But in the summertime, it makes a very big difference, making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally be for a given latitude and elevation. For example, Eismitte is a weather station situated a bit south of the geographical center of the island (near 70&amp;deg;N) at an altitude of 9843 feet. The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70&amp;deg;N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 55&amp;deg;F. Given a lapse rate of 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 35&amp;deg;F. In fact, 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only 10&amp;deg;F, and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only 2&amp;deg;F. June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 2&amp;deg;F lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland&amp;#8217;s ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet lapse rate.

Svalbard is a group of islands extending from about 75&amp;deg;N to 80&amp;deg;N in the very warmest part of the Arctic Ocean, the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as 19&amp;deg;F at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about &amp;#8211;20&amp;deg;F but have fallen as low as &amp;#8211;70&amp;deg;F. This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.


Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above. The temperature of the purest Arctic Ocean water is roughly 28&amp;deg;F at all depths, in all seasons. The temperature of the ice above, however, is much colder because it reflects away some of the heat of the water below it. During the summertime, the upward face of the ice reflects away solar heat and prevents itself from melting completely. The ice that does melt helps keep the average July temperatures at the North Pole at about 31&amp;deg;F.



Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than if they wear white clothes. Ironically, dark skin also serves to aggravate heat loss during the hot summer months, although the human body&amp;#8217;s blood circulation is much more powerful than the albedo effect of its skin. Thus children, much skinnier than adults, need more clothes in the wintertime to keep them warm, even if they are dark-skinned. 




There is a simple relationship between the albedo of an area of the earth&amp;#8217;s surface and its color. The lighter the color, the higher the albedo. A white substance would have an albedo of 1.00, or 100%, while a black substance would have an albedo of 0.00 or 0%. The human eye perceives green light especially well, so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think. For example, the albedo of a pine forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. The ocean, because it is so deep, is even lower, at about 3.5% (the surface temperature of the ocean at the equator is allegedly over 100&amp;deg;F). Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. All of these measurements were taken from Edward Walker&amp;#8217;s study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N, but with different values for latitude and day, they would be different. The reason for this is not because of the amount of sunlight coming in, which does not change a substance&amp;#8217;s albedo, but because the actual environments would be different in summer. For example, a cultivated field may come in as high as the low 20s, depending on the crop being cultivated. Because of increased photosynthesis, all of the values for the forests and swamp lands are nearly doubled in the summer. The grassy field, however, remains at 20% regardless of season or latitude. Near the equator, particularly in rainforest areas, the soil is very black, and its albedo is very close to 0. Some shallow lakes may have albedos as high as 45% during times when the sun is striking the lake from a very acute angle, and more of its light is reflected. Alpine areas often have strange albedo values because of the unusual land formations. 

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 

Snow is the greatest source of albedo in the world, with an albedo that can be as high as 98%. This is for the ideal example, however: deep snow over a treeless landscape with no obstacles around. In the real world, the maximum albedo depends on the environment. Thus, even in the middle of winter with a heavy snow cover, the albedo of weather stations in the pine-forested areas from Europe to Siberia and in the Americas rarely goes above 40%, and many stations in this area have averages around 25%. Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50&amp;#8217;s in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world.


Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that the earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature.

Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect. But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo.

But Kilimanjaro&amp;#8217;s temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level.

By comparison, the [[Hawaii]]an [[volcano]] [[Mauna Loa]], which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 40&amp;deg;F, despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.

But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is 14&amp;deg;F, which reduced to sea level at a rate of 2&amp;deg;F gives 42&amp;deg;F, which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 74&amp;deg;F, and it is during the dry season a dry 77&amp;deg;F, so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.

There is a simple relationship between the albedo of an area of the earth&amp;#8217;s surface and its color. The lighter the color, the higher the albedo. A white substance would have an albedo of 1.00, or 100%, while a black substance would have an albedo of 0.00 or 0%. The human eye perceives green light especially well, so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think. For example, the albedo of a pine forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. The ocean, because it is so deep, is even lower, at about 3.5% (the surface temperature of the ocean at the equator is allegedly over 100&amp;deg;F). Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. All of these measurements were taken from Edward Walker&amp;#8217;s study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N, but with different values for latitude and day, they would be different. The reason for this is not because of the amount of sunlight coming in, which does not change a substance&amp;#8217;s albedo, but because the actual environments would be different in summer. For example, a cultivated field may come in as high as the low 20s, depending on the crop being cultivated. Because of increased photosynthesis, all of the values for the forests and swamp lands are nearly doubled in the summer. The grassy field, however, remains at 20% regardless of season or latitude. Near the equator, particularly in rainforest areas, the soil is very black, and its albedo is very close to 0. Some shallow lakes may have albedos as high as 45% during times when the sun is striking the lake from a very acute angle, and more of its light is reflected. Alpine areas often have strange albedo values because of the unusual land formations. 

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 

Snow is the greatest source of albedo in the world, with an albedo that can be as high as 98%. This is for the ideal example, however: deep snow over a treeless landscape with no obstacles around. In the real world, the maximum albedo depends on the environment. Thus, even in the middle of winter with a heavy snow cover, the albedo of weather stations in the pine-forested areas from Europe to Siberia and in the Americas rarely goes above 40%, and many stations in this area have averages around 25%. Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50&amp;#8217;s in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world.


Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that the earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 20&amp;deg;F colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place.

If the theory of global warming is true, and the polar regions of the planet are going to be rapidly warming up, then the magnitude and path of the warming trend will depend largely on the albedo of the earth&amp;#8217;s polar regions, and to a lesser extent on the albedo of the whole planet. Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect. But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo. If the ice were to melt, the very high-albedo ice would be replaced with some very low-albedo water, and temperatures would rise enormously, perhaps as much as 15&amp;deg;F, which would make the area warmer than any other area at that latitude. (This is what accounts for the unusually warm summers on the islands of Svalbard, in Norway. But Svalbard is surrounded by ocean, whereas the Davis Strait is surrounded by land, and thus has the potential to become even warmer than Svalbard.)

If the ice melted, then there would be a way for the warm waters of the Gulf Stream to penetrate deep into the Arctic, and warm spells would become increasingly frequent. This could accelerate the melting of the Arctic Ocean, a process which would feed on itself. A melted Arctic would help many people living in Arctic areas, but could possibly hurt many others living in other parts of the globe. 


In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old Soviet plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again. Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about 31&amp;deg;F, and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 42&amp;deg;F.)


Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models such as the one at http://climate.gsfc.nasa.gov/~cahalan/FractalClouds/Movies have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about &amp;#8211;240&amp;deg;F. This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 9&amp;deg;F temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, all we would need to do is increase the earth&amp;#8217;s overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

Other scientists, noting the effect of volcanic eruptions on global temperatures, have suggested other ideas, some of which are actually practical, to stop global warming by increasing the earth&amp;#8217;s albedo. While all of these solutions are expensive and would require cooperation from powerful nations, they show that the problem of global warming is not much of a problem at all, that it can be easily controlled and eliminated by human technology. 

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 13&amp;deg;F during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.</text>

'''Albedo''' is a measure of the tendency of a surface to absorb and re-emit incoming [[radiation]], and thus lower its own [[temperature]]. Its value ranges from 0% for an object that absorbs all radiation to 100% for an object that reflects all radiation. Every [[molecule]] of every substance has its own albedo, but albedo can also refer to a collection of very many objects, and can even be applied to objects of a very large scale, such as the planet [[Earth]], which has an albedo of 37-39%.


Since albedo can greatly affect the temperature of an area, it is advantageous for people, especially in cold climates, to settle in areas where the albedo is very low, so that they can get as much warmth as possible from the [[sun]]. The reverse is true in [[desert]] and [[tropic|tropical]] climates; people want to live in areas where as much solar radiation as possible will be emitted back into space. According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]&amp;#8217;s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 5&amp;deg;F warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. To give another example, the entire nation of [[Belgium]], which is among the most urbanized in the world, is considerably warmer than the mostly open, unforested [[France|French]] countryside that lies to its immediate southwest, perhaps also because of albedo effects.

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is acually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 5&amp;deg;F year-round. The difference would most likely be more than 30&amp;deg;F if the landscape of the rainforest was [[white]] instead of dark [[green]]. As evidence for this theory, scientists have climbed to the top of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in [[Tanzania]], which is located in an area well described as &quot;steaming jungle&quot;. But Kilimanjaro&amp;#8217;s temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level. Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 81&amp;deg;F (this is the GHCN&amp;#8217;s record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 2&amp;deg;F per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 41&amp;deg;F, which is much warmer than the approximately 20&amp;deg;F that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the [[Hawaii]]an [[volcano]] [[Mauna Loa]], which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 40&amp;deg;F, despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.

But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is 14&amp;deg;F, which reduced to sea level at a rate of 2&amp;deg;F gives 42&amp;deg;F, which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 74&amp;deg;F, and it is during the dry season a dry 77&amp;deg;F, so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.

The only possible explanation is that on Kilimanjaro, a glacier built up when the climate was colder, and that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat to keep itself cold enough to not melt, and to keep the air temperature at the summit much lower than that atop Mauna Loa. This very wide gap in temperatures, of nearly 20&amp;deg;F, occurs despite the fact that the skies above both mountains are very cloudy and the climate of both is very wet, so not much solar radiation reaches either summit. If Mauna Loa were completely dry, it could be expected that its temperature would be even warmer, perhaps as warm as that of Tibet at 14,000 feet in summer.


Another good example of albedo in action is Greenland. Greenland is an island covered almost completely with ice. In the winter, very little sunlight reaches Greenland, so albedo is not as important. But in the summertime, it makes a very big difference, making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally be for a given latitude and elevation. For example, Eismitte is a weather station situated a bit south of the geographical center of the island (near 70&amp;deg;N) at an altitude of 9843 feet. The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70&amp;deg;N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 55&amp;deg;F. Given a lapse rate of 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 35&amp;deg;F. In fact, 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only 10&amp;deg;F, and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only 2&amp;deg;F. June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 2&amp;deg;F lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland&amp;#8217;s ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet lapse rate.

Svalbard is a group of islands extending from about 75&amp;deg;N to 80&amp;deg;N in the very warmest part of the Arctic Ocean, the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as 19&amp;deg;F at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about &amp;#8211;20&amp;deg;F but have fallen as low as &amp;#8211;70&amp;deg;F. This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.


Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above. The temperature of the purest Arctic Ocean water is roughly 28&amp;deg;F at all depths, in all seasons. The temperature of the ice above, however, is much colder because it reflects away some of the heat of the water below it. During the summertime, the upward face of the ice reflects away solar heat and prevents itself from melting completely. The ice that does melt helps keep the average July temperatures at the North Pole at about 31&amp;deg;F.



Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than if they wear white clothes. Ironically, dark skin also serves to aggravate heat loss during the hot summer months, although the human body&amp;#8217;s blood circulation is much more powerful than the albedo effect of its skin. Thus children, much skinnier than adults, need more clothes in the wintertime to keep them warm, even if they are dark-skinned. 




There is a simple relationship between the albedo of an area of the earth&amp;#8217;s surface and its color. The lighter the color, the higher the albedo. A white substance would have an albedo of 1.00, or 100%, while a black substance would have an albedo of 0.00 or 0%. The human eye perceives green light especially well, so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think. For example, the albedo of a pine forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. The ocean, because it is so deep, is even lower, at about 3.5% (the surface temperature of the ocean at the equator is allegedly over 100&amp;deg;F). Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. All of these measurements were taken from Edward Walker&amp;#8217;s study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N, but with different values for latitude and day, they would be different. The reason for this is not because of the amount of sunlight coming in, which does not change a substance&amp;#8217;s albedo, but because the actual environments would be different in summer. For example, a cultivated field may come in as high as the low 20s, depending on the crop being cultivated. Because of increased photosynthesis, all of the values for the forests and swamp lands are nearly doubled in the summer. The grassy field, however, remains at 20% regardless of season or latitude. Near the equator, particularly in rainforest areas, the soil is very black, and its albedo is very close to 0. Some shallow lakes may have albedos as high as 45% during times when the sun is striking the lake from a very acute angle, and more of its light is reflected.

Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50&amp;#8217;s in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world.

But Kilimanjaro&amp;#8217;s temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level. Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 81&amp;deg;F (this is the GHCN&amp;#8217;s record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 2&amp;deg;F per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 41&amp;deg;F, which is much warmer than the approximately 20&amp;deg;F that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the [[Hawaii]]an [[volcano]] [[Mauna Loa]], which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 40&amp;deg;F, despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.

But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is 14&amp;deg;F, which reduced to sea level at a rate of 2&amp;deg;F gives 42&amp;deg;F, which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 74&amp;deg;F, and it is during the dry season a dry 77&amp;deg;F, so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.

But in the summertime, it makes a very big difference, making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally be for a given latitude and elevation. For example, Eismitte is a weather station situated a bit south of the geographical center of the island (near 70&amp;deg;N) at an altitude of 9843 feet. The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70&amp;deg;N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 55&amp;deg;F. Given a lapse rate of 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 35&amp;deg;F. In fact, 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only 10&amp;deg;F, and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only 2&amp;deg;F. June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 2&amp;deg;F lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland&amp;#8217;s ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet lapse rate.

Svalbard is a group of islands extending from about 75&amp;deg;N to 80&amp;deg;N in the very warmest part of the Arctic Ocean, the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as 19&amp;deg;F at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about &amp;#8211;20&amp;deg;F but have fallen as low as &amp;#8211;70&amp;deg;F. This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.


Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above. The temperature of the purest Arctic Ocean water is roughly 28&amp;deg;F at all depths, in all seasons. The temperature of the ice above, however, is much colder because it reflects away some of the heat of the water below it. During the summertime, the upward face of the ice reflects away solar heat and prevents itself from melting completely. The ice that does melt helps keep the average July temperatures at the North Pole at about 31&amp;deg;F.



Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than if they wear white clothes. Ironically, dark skin also serves to aggravate heat loss during the hot summer months, although the human body&amp;#8217;s blood circulation is much more powerful than the albedo effect of its skin. Thus children, much skinnier than adults, need more clothes in the wintertime to keep them warm, even if they are dark-skinned. 




There is a simple relationship between the albedo of an area of the earth&amp;#8217;s surface and its color. The lighter the color, the higher the albedo. A white substance would have an albedo of 1.00, or 100%, while a black substance would have an albedo of 0.00 or 0%. The human eye perceives green light especially well, so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think. For example, the albedo of a pine forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. The ocean, because it is so deep, is even lower, at about 3.5% (the surface temperature of the ocean at the equator is allegedly over 100&amp;deg;F). Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. All of these measurements were taken from Edward Walker&amp;#8217;s study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N, but with different values for latitude and day, they would be different. The reason for this is not because of the amount of sunlight coming in, which does not change a substance&amp;#8217;s albedo, but because the actual environments would be different in summer. For example, a cultivated field may come in as high as the low 20s, depending on the crop being cultivated. Because of increased photosynthesis, all of the values for the forests and swamp lands are nearly doubled in the summer. The grassy field, however, remains at 20% regardless of season or latitude. Near the equator, particularly in rainforest areas, the soil is very black, and its albedo is very close to 0. Some shallow lakes may have albedos as high as 45% during times when the sun is striking the lake from a very acute angle, and more of its light is reflected. Alpine areas often have strange albedo values because of the unusual land formations. 

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 

Snow is the greatest source of albedo in the world, with an albedo that can be as high as 98%. This is for the ideal example, however: deep snow over a treeless landscape with no obstacles around. In the real world, the maximum albedo depends on the environment. Thus, even in the middle of winter with a heavy snow cover, the albedo of weather stations in the pine-forested areas from Europe to Siberia and in the Americas rarely goes above 40%, and many stations in this area have averages around 25%. Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50&amp;#8217;s in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world.


Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that the earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 20&amp;deg;F colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place.

If the theory of global warming is true, and the polar regions of the planet are going to be rapidly warming up, then the magnitude and path of the warming trend will depend largely on the albedo of the earth&amp;#8217;s polar regions, and to a lesser extent on the albedo of the whole planet. Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect. But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo. If the ice were to melt, the very high-albedo ice would be replaced with some very low-albedo water, and temperatures would rise enormously, perhaps as much as 15&amp;deg;F, which would make the area warmer than any other area at that latitude. (This is what accounts for the unusually warm summers on the islands of Svalbard, in Norway. But Svalbard is surrounded by ocean, whereas the Davis Strait is surrounded by land, and thus has the potential to become even warmer than Svalbard.)

If the ice melted, then there would be a way for the warm waters of the Gulf Stream to penetrate deep into the Arctic, and warm spells would become increasingly frequent. This could accelerate the melting of the Arctic Ocean, a process which would feed on itself. A melted Arctic would help many people living in Arctic areas, but could possibly hurt many others living in other parts of the globe. 


In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old Soviet plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again. Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about 31&amp;deg;F, and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 42&amp;deg;F.)


Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models such as the one at http://climate.gsfc.nasa.gov/~cahalan/FractalClouds/Movies have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about &amp;#8211;240&amp;deg;F. This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 9&amp;deg;F temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, all we would need to do is increase the earth&amp;#8217;s overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

Other scientists, noting the effect of volcanic eruptions on global temperatures, have suggested other ideas, some of which are actually practical, to stop global warming by increasing the earth&amp;#8217;s albedo. While all of these solutions are expensive and would require cooperation from powerful nations, they show that the problem of global warming is not much of a problem at all, that it can be easily controlled and eliminated by human technology. 

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 13&amp;deg;F during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.</text>

'''Albedo''' is a measure of the tendency of a surface to absorb and re-emit incoming [[radiation]], and thus lower its own [[temperature]]. Its value ranges from 0% for an object that absorbs all radiation to 100% for an object that reflects all radiation. Every [[molecule]] of every substance has its own albedo, but albedo can also refer to a collection of very many objects, and can even be applied to objects of a very large scale, such as the planet [[Earth]], which has an albedo of 37-39%.


Since albedo can greatly affect the temperature of an area, it is advantageous for people, especially in cold climates, to settle in areas where the albedo is very low, so that they can get as much warmth as possible from the [[sun]]. The reverse is true in [[desert]] and [[tropic|tropical]] climates; people want to live in areas where as much solar radiation as possible will be emitted back into space. According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]&amp;#8217;s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 5&amp;deg;F warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. To give another example, the entire nation of [[Belgium]], which is among the most urbanized in the world, is considerably warmer than the mostly open, unforested [[France|French]] countryside that lies to its immediate southwest, perhaps also because of albedo effects.

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is acually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 5&amp;deg;F year-round. The difference would most likely be more than 30&amp;deg;F if the landscape of the rainforest was [[white]] instead of dark [[green]]. As evidence for this theory, scientists have climbed to the top of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in [[Tanzania]], which is located in an area well described as &quot;steaming jungle&quot;. But Kilimanjaro&amp;#8217;s temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level. Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 81&amp;deg;F (this is the GHCN&amp;#8217;s record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 2&amp;deg;F per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 41&amp;deg;F, which is much warmer than the approximately 20&amp;deg;F that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the [[Hawaii]]an [[volcano]] [[Mauna Loa]], which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 40&amp;deg;F, despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.

But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is 14&amp;deg;F, which reduced to sea level at a rate of 2&amp;deg;F gives 42&amp;deg;F, which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 74&amp;deg;F, and it is during the dry season a dry 77&amp;deg;F, so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.

The only possible explanation is that on Kilimanjaro, a glacier built up when the climate was colder, and that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat to keep itself cold enough not to melt, and to keep the air temperature at the summit much lower than that atop Mauna Loa. This very wide gap in temperatures, of nearly 20&amp;deg;F, occurs despite the fact that the skies above both mountains are very cloudy and the climate of both is very wet, so not much solar radiation reaches either summit. If Mauna Loa were completely dry, it could be expected that its temperature would be even warmer, perhaps as warm as that of Tibet at 14,000 feet in summer.


Another good example of albedo in action is Greenland. Greenland is an island covered almost completely with ice. In the winter, very little sunlight reaches Greenland, so albedo is not as important. But in the summertime, it makes a very big difference, making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally be for a given latitude and elevation. For example, Eismitte is a weather station situated a bit south of the geographical center of the island (near 70&amp;deg;N) at an altitude of 9843 feet. The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70&amp;deg;N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 55&amp;deg;F. Given a lapse rate of 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 35&amp;deg;F. In fact, 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only 10&amp;deg;F, and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only 2&amp;deg;F. June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 2&amp;deg;F lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland&amp;#8217;s ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet lapse rate.

Svalbard is a group of islands extending from about 75&amp;deg;N to 80&amp;deg;N in the very warmest part of the Arctic Ocean, the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as 19&amp;deg;F at one weather station.

And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about &amp;#8211;20&amp;deg;F but have fallen as low as &amp;#8211;70&amp;deg;F. This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.

The difference would most likely be more than 30&amp;deg;F if the landscape of the rainforest was [[white]] instead of dark [[green]]. As evidence for this theory, scientists have climbed to the top of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in [[Tanzania]], which is located in an area well described as &quot;steaming jungle&quot;. But Kilimanjaro's temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level. Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 81&amp;deg;F (this is the GHCN's record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 2&amp;deg;F per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 41&amp;deg;F, which is much warmer than the approximately 20&amp;deg;F that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the [[Hawaii]]an [[volcano]] [[Mauna Loa]], which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 40&amp;deg;F, despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.

But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is 14&amp;deg;F, which reduced to sea level at a rate of 2&amp;deg;F gives 42&amp;deg;F, which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 74&amp;deg;F, and it is during the dry season a dry 77&amp;deg;F, so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.

The only possible explanation is that on Kilimanjaro, a glacier built up when the climate was colder, and that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat to keep itself cold enough not to melt, and to keep the air temperature at the summit much lower than that atop Mauna Loa. This very wide gap in temperatures, of nearly 20&amp;deg;F, occurs despite the fact that the skies above both mountains are very cloudy and the climate of both is very wet, so not much solar radiation reaches either summit. If Mauna Loa were completely dry, it could be expected that its temperature would be even warmer, perhaps as warm as that of Tibet at 14,000 feet in summer.


Another good example of albedo in action is Greenland. Greenland is an island covered almost completely with ice. In the winter, very little sunlight reaches Greenland, so albedo is not as important. But in the summertime, it makes a very big difference, making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally be for a given latitude and elevation. For example, Eismitte is a weather station situated a bit south of the geographical center of the island (near 70&amp;deg;N) at an altitude of 9843 feet. The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70&amp;deg;N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 55&amp;deg;F. Given a lapse rate of 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 35&amp;deg;F. In fact, 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only 10&amp;deg;F, and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only 2&amp;deg;F. June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 2&amp;deg;F lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland's ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet lapse rate.

Svalbard is a group of islands extending from about 75&amp;deg;N to 80&amp;deg;N in the very warmest part of the Arctic Ocean, the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as 19&amp;deg;F at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about &amp;#8211;20&amp;deg;F but have fallen as low as &amp;#8211;70&amp;deg;F. This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.


Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above. The temperature of the purest Arctic Ocean water is roughly 28&amp;deg;F at all depths, in all seasons. The temperature of the ice above, however, is much colder because it reflects away some of the heat of the water below it. During the summertime, the upward face of the ice reflects away solar heat and prevents itself from melting completely. The ice that does melt helps keep the average July temperatures at the North Pole at about 31&amp;deg;F.



Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than if they wear white clothes. Ironically, dark skin also serves to aggravate heat loss during the hot summer months, although the human body's blood circulation is much more powerful than the albedo effect of its skin. Thus children, much skinnier than adults, need more clothes in the wintertime to keep them warm, even if they are dark-skinned. 




There is a simple relationship between the albedo of an area of the earth's surface and its color. The lighter the color, the higher the albedo. A white substance would have an albedo of 1.00, or 100%, while a black substance would have an albedo of 0.00 or 0%. The human eye perceives green light especially well, so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think. For example, the albedo of a pine forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. The ocean, because it is so deep, is even lower, at about 3.5% (the surface temperature of the ocean at the equator is allegedly over 100&amp;deg;F). Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. All of these measurements were taken from Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N, but with different values for latitude and day, they would be different. The reason for this is not because of the amount of sunlight coming in, which does not change a substance's albedo, but because the actual environments would be different in summer. For example, a cultivated field may come in as high as the low 20s, depending on the crop being cultivated. Because of increased photosynthesis, all of the values for the forests and swamp lands are nearly doubled in the summer. The grassy field, however, remains at 20% regardless of season or latitude. Near the equator, particularly in rainforest areas, the soil is very black, and its albedo is very close to 0. Some shallow lakes may have albedos as high as 45% during times when the sun is striking the lake from a very acute angle, and more of its light is reflected. Alpine areas often have strange albedo values because of the unusual land formations. 

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 

Snow is the greatest source of albedo in the world, with an albedo that can be as high as 98%. This is for the ideal example, however: deep snow over a treeless landscape with no obstacles around. In the real world, the maximum albedo depends on the environment. Thus, even in the middle of winter with a heavy snow cover, the albedo of weather stations in the pine-forested areas from Europe to Siberia and in the Americas rarely goes above 40%, and many stations in this area have averages around 25%. Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50's in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world.


Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that the earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 20&amp;deg;F colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place.

If the theory of global warming is true, and the polar regions of the planet are going to be rapidly warming up, then the magnitude and path of the warming trend will depend largely on the albedo of the earth's polar regions, and to a lesser extent on the albedo of the whole planet. Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect. But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo. If the ice were to melt, the very high-albedo ice would be replaced with some very low-albedo water, and temperatures would rise enormously, perhaps as much as 15&amp;deg;F, which would make the area warmer than any other area at that latitude. (This is what accounts for the unusually warm summers on the islands of Svalbard, in Norway. But Svalbard is surrounded by ocean, whereas the Davis Strait is surrounded by land, and thus has the potential to become even warmer than Svalbard.)

If the ice melted, then there would be a way for the warm waters of the Gulf Stream to penetrate deep into the Arctic, and warm spells would become increasingly frequent. This could accelerate the melting of the Arctic Ocean, a process which would feed on itself. A melted Arctic would help many people living in Arctic areas, but could possibly hurt many others living in other parts of the globe. 


In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old Soviet plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again. Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about 31&amp;deg;F, and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 42&amp;deg;F.)


Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models such as the one at http://climate.gsfc.nasa.gov/~cahalan/FractalClouds/Movies have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about &amp;#8211;240&amp;deg;F. This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 9&amp;deg;F temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, all we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

Other scientists, noting the effect of volcanic eruptions on global temperatures, have suggested other ideas, some of which are actually practical, to stop global warming by increasing the earth's albedo. While all of these solutions are expensive and would require cooperation from powerful nations, they show that the problem of global warming is not much of a problem at all, that it can be easily controlled and eliminated by human technology. 

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 13&amp;deg;F during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.</text>

'''Albedo''' is a measure of the tendency of a surface to absorb and re-emit incoming [[radiation]], and thus lower its own [[temperature]]. Its value ranges from 0% for an object that absorbs all radiation to 100% for an object that reflects all radiation. Every [[molecule]] of every substance has its own albedo, but albedo can also refer to a collection of very many objects, and can even be applied to objects of a very large scale, such as the planet [[Earth]], which has an albedo of 37-39%.


Since albedo can greatly affect the temperature of an area, it is advantageous for people, especially in cold climates, to settle in areas where the albedo is very low, so that they can get as much warmth as possible from the [[sun]]. The reverse is true in [[desert]] and [[tropic|tropical]] climates; people want to live in areas where as much solar radiation as possible will be emitted back into space. According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 5&amp;deg;F warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. To give another example, the entire nation of [[Belgium]], which is among the most urbanized in the world, is considerably warmer than the mostly open, unforested [[France|French]] countryside that lies to its immediate southwest, perhaps also because of albedo effects.

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is acually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 5&amp;deg;F year-round. The difference would most likely be more than 30&amp;deg;F if the landscape of the rainforest was [[white]] instead of dark [[green]]. As evidence for this theory, scientists have climbed to the top of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in [[Tanzania]], which is located in an area well described as &quot;steaming jungle&quot;. But Kilimanjaro's temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level. Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 81&amp;deg;F (this is the GHCN's record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 2&amp;deg;F per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 41&amp;deg;F, which is much warmer than the approximately 20&amp;deg;F that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the [[Hawaii]]an [[volcano]] [[Mauna Loa]], which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 40&amp;deg;F, despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.

But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is 14&amp;deg;F, which reduced to sea level at a rate of 2&amp;deg;F gives 42&amp;deg;F, which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 74&amp;deg;F, and it is during the dry season a dry 77&amp;deg;F, so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.

The only possible explanation is that on Kilimanjaro, a glacier built up when the climate was colder, and that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat to keep itself cold enough not to melt, and to keep the air temperature at the summit much lower than that atop Mauna Loa. This very wide gap in temperatures, of nearly 20&amp;deg;F, occurs despite the fact that the skies above both mountains are very cloudy and the climate of both is very wet, so not much solar radiation reaches either summit. If Mauna Loa were completely dry, it could be expected that its temperature would be even warmer, perhaps as warm as that of Tibet at 14,000 feet in summer.


Another good example of albedo in action is Greenland. Greenland is an island covered almost completely with ice. In the winter, very little sunlight reaches Greenland, so albedo is not as important. But in the summertime, it makes a very big difference, making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally be for a given latitude and elevation. For example, Eismitte is a weather station situated a bit south of the geographical center of the island (near 70&amp;deg;N) at an altitude of 9843 feet. The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70&amp;deg;N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 55&amp;deg;F. Given a lapse rate of 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 35&amp;deg;F. In fact, 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only 10&amp;deg;F, and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only 2&amp;deg;F. June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 2&amp;deg;F lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland's ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet lapse rate.

Svalbard is a group of islands extending from about 75&amp;deg;N to 80&amp;deg;N in the very warmest part of the Arctic Ocean, the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as 19&amp;deg;F at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about &amp;#8211;20&amp;deg;F but have fallen as low as &amp;#8211;70&amp;deg;F. This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.


Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above. The temperature of the purest Arctic Ocean water is roughly 28&amp;deg;F at all depths, in all seasons. The temperature of the ice above, however, is much colder because it reflects away some of the heat of the water below it. During the summertime, the upward face of the ice reflects away solar heat and prevents itself from melting completely. The ice that does melt helps keep the average July temperatures at the North Pole at about 31&amp;deg;F.



Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than if they wear white clothes. Ironically, dark skin also serves to aggravate heat loss during the hot summer months, although the human body's blood circulation is much more powerful than the albedo effect of its skin. Thus children, much skinnier than adults, need more clothes in the wintertime to keep them warm, even if they are dark-skinned. 




There is a simple relationship between the albedo of an area of the earth's surface and its color. The lighter the color, the higher the albedo. A white substance would have an albedo of 1.00, or 100%, while a black substance would have an albedo of 0.00 or 0%. The human eye perceives green light especially well, so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think. For example, the albedo of a pine forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. The ocean, because it is so deep, is even lower, at about 3.5% (the surface temperature of the ocean at the equator is allegedly over 100&amp;deg;F). Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. All of these measurements were taken from Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N, but with different values for latitude and day, they would be different. The reason for this is not because of the amount of sunlight coming in, which does not change a substance's albedo, but because the actual environments would be different in summer. For example, a cultivated field may come in as high as the low 20s, depending on the crop being cultivated. Because of increased photosynthesis, all of the values for the forests and swamp lands are nearly doubled in the summer. The grassy field, however, remains at 20% regardless of season or latitude. Near the equator, particularly in rainforest areas, the soil is very black, and its albedo is very close to 0. Some shallow lakes may have albedos as high as 45% during times when the sun is striking the lake from a very acute angle, and more of its light is reflected. Alpine areas often have strange albedo values because of the unusual land formations. 

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 

Snow is the greatest source of albedo in the world, with an albedo that can be as high as 98%. This is for the ideal example, however: deep snow over a treeless landscape with no obstacles around. In the real world, the maximum albedo depends on the environment. Thus, even in the middle of winter with a heavy snow cover, the albedo of weather stations in the pine-forested areas from Europe to Siberia and in the Americas rarely goes above 40%, and many stations in this area have averages around 25%. Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50's in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world.


Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that the earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 20&amp;deg;F colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place.

If the theory of global warming is true, and the polar regions of the planet are going to be rapidly warming up, then the magnitude and path of the warming trend will depend largely on the albedo of the earth's polar regions, and to a lesser extent on the albedo of the whole planet. Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect. But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo. If the ice were to melt, the very high-albedo ice would be replaced with some very low-albedo water, and temperatures would rise enormously, perhaps as much as 15&amp;deg;F, which would make the area warmer than any other area at that latitude. (This is what accounts for the unusually warm summers on the islands of Svalbard, in Norway. But Svalbard is surrounded by ocean, whereas the Davis Strait is surrounded by land, and thus has the potential to become even warmer than Svalbard.)

If the ice melted, then there would be a way for the warm waters of the Gulf Stream to penetrate deep into the Arctic, and warm spells would become increasingly frequent. This could accelerate the melting of the Arctic Ocean, a process which would feed on itself. A melted Arctic would help many people living in Arctic areas, but could possibly hurt many others living in other parts of the globe. 


In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old Soviet plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again. Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about 31&amp;deg;F, and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 42&amp;deg;F.)


Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models such as the one at http://climate.gsfc.nasa.gov/~cahalan/FractalClouds/Movies have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about &amp;#8211;240&amp;deg;F. This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 9&amp;deg;F temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, all we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

Other scientists, noting the effect of volcanic eruptions on global temperatures, have suggested other ideas, some of which are actually practical, to stop global warming by increasing the earth's albedo. While all of these solutions are expensive and would require cooperation from powerful nations, they show that the problem of global warming is not much of a problem at all, that it can be easily controlled and eliminated by human technology. 

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 13&amp;deg;F during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[de:Albedo]] [[fr:Albédo]]

'''Albedo''' is a measure of the tendency of a surface to absorb and re-emit incoming [[radiation]], and thus lower its own [[temperature]]. Its value ranges from 0% for an object that absorbs all radiation to 100% for an object that reflects all radiation. Every [[molecule]] of every substance has its own albedo, but albedo can also refer to a collection of very many objects, and can even be applied to objects of a very large scale, such as the planet [[Earth]], which has an albedo of 37-39%.


Since albedo can greatly affect the temperature of an area, it is advantageous for people, especially in cold climates, to settle in areas where the albedo is very low, so that they can get as much warmth as possible from the [[sun]]. The reverse is true in [[desert]] and [[tropic|tropical]] climates; people want to live in areas where as much solar radiation as possible will be emitted back into space. According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 5&amp;deg;F warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. To give another example, the entire nation of [[Belgium]], which is among the most urbanized in the world, is considerably warmer than the mostly open, unforested [[France|French]] countryside that lies to its immediate southwest, perhaps also because of albedo effects.

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is acually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 5&amp;deg;F year-round. The difference would most likely be more than 30&amp;deg;F if the landscape of the rainforest was [[white]] instead of dark [[green]]. As evidence for this theory, scientists have climbed to the top of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in [[Tanzania]], which is located in an area well described as &quot;steaming jungle&quot;. But Kilimanjaro's temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level. Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 81&amp;deg;F (this is the GHCN's record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 2&amp;deg;F per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 41&amp;deg;F, which is much warmer than the approximately 20&amp;deg;F that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the [[Hawaii]]an [[volcano]] [[Mauna Loa]], which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 40&amp;deg;F, despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.

But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is 14&amp;deg;F, which reduced to sea level at a rate of 2&amp;deg;F gives 42&amp;deg;F, which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 74&amp;deg;F, and it is during the dry season a dry 77&amp;deg;F, so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.

The only possible explanation is that on Kilimanjaro, a glacier built up when the climate was colder, and that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat to keep itself cold enough not to melt, and to keep the air temperature at the summit much lower than that atop Mauna Loa. This very wide gap in temperatures, of nearly 20&amp;deg;F, occurs despite the fact that the skies above both mountains are very cloudy and the climate of both is very wet, so not much solar radiation reaches either summit. If Mauna Loa were completely dry, it could be expected that its temperature would be even warmer, perhaps as warm as that of Tibet at 14,000 feet in summer.


Another good example of albedo in action is Greenland. Greenland is an island covered almost completely with ice. In the winter, very little sunlight reaches Greenland, so albedo is not as important. But in the summertime, it makes a very big difference, making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally be for a given latitude and elevation. For example, Eismitte is a weather station situated a bit south of the geographical center of the island (near 70&amp;deg;N) at an altitude of 9843 feet. The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70&amp;deg;N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 55&amp;deg;F. Given a lapse rate of 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 35&amp;deg;F. In fact, 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only 10&amp;deg;F, and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only 2&amp;deg;F. June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 2&amp;deg;F lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland's ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet lapse rate.

Svalbard is a group of islands extending from about 75&amp;deg;N to 80&amp;deg;N in the very warmest part of the Arctic Ocean, the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as 19&amp;deg;F at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about &amp;#8211;20&amp;deg;F but have fallen as low as &amp;#8211;70&amp;deg;F. This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.


Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above. The temperature of the purest Arctic Ocean water is roughly 28&amp;deg;F at all depths, in all seasons. The temperature of the ice above, however, is much colder because it reflects away some of the heat of the water below it. During the summertime, the upward face of the ice reflects away solar heat and prevents itself from melting completely. The ice that does melt helps keep the average July temperatures at the North Pole at about 31&amp;deg;F.



Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than if they wear white clothes. Ironically, dark skin also serves to aggravate heat loss during the hot summer months, although the human body's blood circulation is much more powerful than the albedo effect of its skin. Thus children, much skinnier than adults, need more clothes in the wintertime to keep them warm, even if they are dark-skinned. 




There is a simple relationship between the albedo of an area of the earth's surface and its color. The lighter the color, the higher the albedo. A white substance would have an albedo of 1.00, or 100%, while a black substance would have an albedo of 0.00 or 0%. The human eye perceives green light especially well, so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think. For example, the albedo of a pine forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. The ocean, because it is so deep, is even lower, at about 3.5% (the surface temperature of the ocean at the equator is allegedly over 100&amp;deg;F). Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. All of these measurements were taken from Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N, but with different values for latitude and day, they would be different. The reason for this is not because of the amount of sunlight coming in, which does not change a substance's albedo, but because the actual environments would be different in summer. For example, a cultivated field may come in as high as the low 20s, depending on the crop being cultivated. Because of increased photosynthesis, all of the values for the forests and swamp lands are nearly doubled in the summer. The grassy field, however, remains at 20% regardless of season or latitude. Near the equator, particularly in rainforest areas, the soil is very black, and its albedo is very close to 0. Some shallow lakes may have albedos as high as 45% during times when the sun is striking the lake from a very acute angle, and more of its light is reflected. Alpine areas often have strange albedo values because of the unusual land formations. 

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 

Snow is the greatest source of albedo in the world, with an albedo that can be as high as 98%. This is for the ideal example, however: deep snow over a treeless landscape with no obstacles around. In the real world, the maximum albedo depends on the environment. Thus, even in the middle of winter with a heavy snow cover, the albedo of weather stations in the pine-forested areas from Europe to Siberia and in the Americas rarely goes above 40%, and many stations in this area have averages around 25%. Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50's in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world.


Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that the earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 20&amp;deg;F colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place.

If the theory of global warming is true, and the polar regions of the planet are going to be rapidly warming up, then the magnitude and path of the warming trend will depend largely on the albedo of the earth's polar regions, and to a lesser extent on the albedo of the whole planet. Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect. But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo. If the ice were to melt, the very high-albedo ice would be replaced with some very low-albedo water, and temperatures would rise enormously, perhaps as much as 15&amp;deg;F, which would make the area warmer than any other area at that latitude. (This is what accounts for the unusually warm summers on the islands of Svalbard, in Norway. But Svalbard is surrounded by ocean, whereas the Davis Strait is surrounded by land, and thus has the potential to become even warmer than Svalbard.)

If the ice melted, then there would be a way for the warm waters of the Gulf Stream to penetrate deep into the Arctic, and warm spells would become increasingly frequent. This could accelerate the melting of the Arctic Ocean, a process which would feed on itself. A melted Arctic would help many people living in Arctic areas, but could possibly hurt many others living in other parts of the globe. 


In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old Soviet plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again. Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about 31&amp;deg;F, and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 42&amp;deg;F.)


Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models such as the one at http://climate.gsfc.nasa.gov/~cahalan/FractalClouds/Movies have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about &amp;#8211;240&amp;deg;F. This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 9&amp;deg;F temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, all we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

Other scientists, noting the effect of volcanic eruptions on global temperatures, have suggested other ideas, some of which are actually practical, to stop global warming by increasing the earth's albedo. While all of these solutions are expensive and would require cooperation from powerful nations, they show that the problem of global warming is not much of a problem at all, that it can be easily controlled and eliminated by human technology. 

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 13&amp;deg;F during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.</text>

The difference would most likely be more than 30&amp;deg;F if the landscape of the rainforest was [[white]] instead of dark [[green]]. As evidence for this theory, scientists have climbed to the top of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in [[Tanzania]], which is located in an area well described as &quot;steaming jungle&quot;. But Kilimanjaro's temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level. Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 81&amp;deg;F (this is the GHCN's record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 2&amp;deg;F per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 41&amp;deg;F, which is much warmer than the approximately 20&amp;deg;F that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the [[Hawaii]]an [[volcano]] [[Mauna Loa]], which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 40&amp;deg;F, despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.

But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is 14&amp;deg;F, which reduced to sea level at a rate of 2&amp;deg;F gives 42&amp;deg;F, which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 74&amp;deg;F, and it is during the dry season a dry 77&amp;deg;F, so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.

The only possible explanation is that on Kilimanjaro, a glacier built up when the climate was colder, and that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat to keep itself cold enough not to melt, and to keep the air temperature at the summit much lower than that atop Mauna Loa. This very wide gap in temperatures, of nearly 20&amp;deg;F, occurs despite the fact that the skies above both mountains are very cloudy and the climate of both is very wet, so not much solar radiation reaches either summit. If Mauna Loa were completely dry, it could be expected that its temperature would be even warmer, perhaps as warm as that of Tibet at 14,000 feet in summer.

But in the summertime, it makes a very big difference, making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally be for a given latitude and elevation.

The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70&amp;deg;N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 55&amp;deg;F. Given a lapse rate of 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 35&amp;deg;F. In fact, 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only 10&amp;deg;F, and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only 2&amp;deg;F. June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 2&amp;deg;F lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland's ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet lapse rate.

But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about &amp;#8211;20&amp;deg;F but have fallen as low as &amp;#8211;70&amp;deg;F. This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.


Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above. The temperature of the purest Arctic Ocean water is roughly 28&amp;deg;F at all depths, in all seasons. The temperature of the ice above, however, is much colder because it reflects away some of the heat of the water below it. During the summertime, the upward face of the ice reflects away solar heat and prevents itself from melting completely. The ice that does melt helps keep the average July temperatures at the North Pole at about 31&amp;deg;F.

Thus children, much skinnier than adults, need more clothes in the wintertime to keep them warm, even if they are dark-skinned. 




There is a simple relationship between the albedo of an area of the earth's surface and its color. The lighter the color, the higher the albedo. A white substance would have an albedo of 1.00, or 100%, while a black substance would have an albedo of 0.00 or 0%. The human eye perceives green light especially well, so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think. For example, the albedo of a pine forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. The ocean, because it is so deep, is even lower, at about 3.5% (the surface temperature of the ocean at the equator is allegedly over 100&amp;deg;F). Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. All of these measurements were taken from Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N, but with different values for latitude and day, they would be different. The reason for this is not because of the amount of sunlight coming in, which does not change a substance's albedo, but because the actual environments would be different in summer. For example, a cultivated field may come in as high as the low 20s, depending on the crop being cultivated. Because of increased photosynthesis, all of the values for the forests and swamp lands are nearly doubled in the summer. The grassy field, however, remains at 20% regardless of season or latitude. Near the equator, particularly in rainforest areas, the soil is very black, and its albedo is very close to 0. Some shallow lakes may have albedos as high as 45% during times when the sun is striking the lake from a very acute angle, and more of its light is reflected. Alpine areas often have strange albedo values because of the unusual land formations. 

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 

Snow is the greatest source of albedo in the world, with an albedo that can be as high as 98%. This is for the ideal example, however: deep snow over a treeless landscape with no obstacles around. In the real world, the maximum albedo depends on the environment. Thus, even in the middle of winter with a heavy snow cover, the albedo of weather stations in the pine-forested areas from Europe to Siberia and in the Americas rarely goes above 40%, and many stations in this area have averages around 25%. Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50's in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world.


Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that the earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 20&amp;deg;F colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place.

If the theory of global warming is true, and the polar regions of the planet are going to be rapidly warming up, then the magnitude and path of the warming trend will depend largely on the albedo of the earth's polar regions, and to a lesser extent on the albedo of the whole planet. Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect. But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo. If the ice were to melt, the very high-albedo ice would be replaced with some very low-albedo water, and temperatures would rise enormously, perhaps as much as 15&amp;deg;F, which would make the area warmer than any other area at that latitude. (This is what accounts for the unusually warm summers on the islands of Svalbard, in Norway. But Svalbard is surrounded by ocean, whereas the Davis Strait is surrounded by land, and thus has the potential to become even warmer than Svalbard.)

If the ice melted, then there would be a way for the warm waters of the Gulf Stream to penetrate deep into the Arctic, and warm spells would become increasingly frequent. This could accelerate the melting of the Arctic Ocean, a process which would feed on itself. A melted Arctic would help many people living in Arctic areas, but could possibly hurt many others living in other parts of the globe. 


In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old Soviet plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again. Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about 31&amp;deg;F, and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 42&amp;deg;F.)


Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models such as the one at http://climate.gsfc.nasa.gov/~cahalan/FractalClouds/Movies have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about &amp;#8211;240&amp;deg;F. This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 9&amp;deg;F temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, all we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

Other scientists, noting the effect of volcanic eruptions on global temperatures, have suggested other ideas, some of which are actually practical, to stop global warming by increasing the earth's albedo. While all of these solutions are expensive and would require cooperation from powerful nations, they show that the problem of global warming is not much of a problem at all, that it can be easily controlled and eliminated by human technology. 

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 13&amp;deg;F during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.</text>

'''Albedo''' is a measure of the tendency of a surface to absorb and re-emit incoming [[radiation]], and thus lower its own [[temperature]]. Its value ranges from 0% for an object that absorbs all radiation to 100% for an object that reflects all radiation. Every [[molecule]] of every substance has its own albedo, but albedo can also refer to a collection of very many objects, and can even be applied to objects of a very large scale, such as the planet [[Earth]], which has an albedo of 37-39%.


Since albedo can greatly affect the temperature of an area, it is advantageous for people, especially in cold climates, to settle in areas where the albedo is very low, so that they can get as much warmth as possible from the [[sun]]. The reverse is true in [[desert]] and [[tropic|tropical]] climates; people want to live in areas where as much solar radiation as possible will be emitted back into space. According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 5&amp;deg;F warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. To give another example, the entire nation of [[Belgium]], which is among the most urbanized in the world, is considerably warmer than the mostly open, unforested [[France|French]] countryside that lies to its immediate southwest, perhaps also because of albedo effects.

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is acually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 5&amp;deg;F year-round. The difference would most likely be more than 30&amp;deg;F if the landscape of the rainforest was [[white]] instead of dark [[green]]. As evidence for this theory, scientists have climbed to the top of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in [[Tanzania]], which is located in an area well described as &quot;steaming jungle&quot;. But Kilimanjaro's temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level. Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 81&amp;deg;F (this is the GHCN's record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 2&amp;deg;F per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 41&amp;deg;F, which is much warmer than the approximately 20&amp;deg;F that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the [[Hawaii]]an [[volcano]] [[Mauna Loa]], which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 40&amp;deg;F, despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.

But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is 14&amp;deg;F, which reduced to sea level at a rate of 2&amp;deg;F gives 42&amp;deg;F, which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 74&amp;deg;F, and it is during the dry season a dry 77&amp;deg;F, so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.

The only possible explanation is that on Kilimanjaro, a glacier built up when the climate was colder, and that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat to keep itself cold enough not to melt, and to keep the air temperature at the summit much lower than that atop Mauna Loa. This very wide gap in temperatures, of nearly 20&amp;deg;F, occurs despite the fact that the skies above both mountains are very cloudy and the climate of both is very wet, so not much solar radiation reaches either summit. If Mauna Loa were completely dry, it could be expected that its temperature would be even warmer, perhaps as warm as that of Tibet at 14,000 feet in summer.


Another good example of albedo in action is Greenland. Greenland is an island covered almost completely with ice. In the winter, very little sunlight reaches Greenland, so albedo is not as important. But in the summertime, it makes a very big difference, making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally be for a given latitude and elevation. For example, Eismitte is a weather station situated a bit south of the geographical center of the island (near 70&amp;deg;N) at an altitude of 9843 feet. The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70&amp;deg;N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 55&amp;deg;F. Given a lapse rate of 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 35&amp;deg;F. In fact, 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only 10&amp;deg;F, and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only 2&amp;deg;F. June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 2&amp;deg;F lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland's ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet lapse rate.

Svalbard is a group of islands extending from about 75&amp;deg;N to 80&amp;deg;N in the very warmest part of the Arctic Ocean, the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as 19&amp;deg;F at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about &amp;#8211;20&amp;deg;F but have fallen as low as &amp;#8211;70&amp;deg;F. This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.


Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above. The temperature of the purest Arctic Ocean water is roughly 28&amp;deg;F at all depths, in all seasons. The temperature of the ice above, however, is much colder because it reflects away some of the heat of the water below it. During the summertime, the upward face of the ice reflects away solar heat and prevents itself from melting completely. The ice that does melt helps keep the average July temperatures at the North Pole at about 31&amp;deg;F.



Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than if they wear white clothes. Ironically, dark skin also serves to aggravate heat loss during the hot summer months, although the human body's blood circulation is much more powerful than the albedo effect of its skin. Thus children, much skinnier than adults, need more clothes in the wintertime to keep them warm, even if they are dark-skinned. 




There is a simple relationship between the albedo of an area of the earth's surface and its color. The lighter the color, the higher the albedo. A white substance would have an albedo of 1.00, or 100%, while a black substance would have an albedo of 0.00 or 0%. The human eye perceives green light especially well, so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think. For example, the albedo of a pine forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. The ocean, because it is so deep, is even lower, at about 3.5% (the surface temperature of the ocean at the equator is allegedly over 100&amp;deg;F). Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. All of these measurements were taken from Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N, but with different values for latitude and day, they would be different. The reason for this is not because of the amount of sunlight coming in, which does not change a substance's albedo, but because the actual environments would be different in summer. For example, a cultivated field may come in as high as the low 20s, depending on the crop being cultivated. Because of increased photosynthesis, all of the values for the forests and swamp lands are nearly doubled in the summer. The grassy field, however, remains at 20% regardless of season or latitude. Near the equator, particularly in rainforest areas, the soil is very black, and its albedo is very close to 0. Some shallow lakes may have albedos as high as 45% during times when the sun is striking the lake from a very acute angle, and more of its light is reflected. Alpine areas often have strange albedo values because of the unusual land formations. 

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 

Snow is the greatest source of albedo in the world, with an albedo that can be as high as 98%. This is for the ideal example, however: deep snow over a treeless landscape with no obstacles around. In the real world, the maximum albedo depends on the environment. Thus, even in the middle of winter with a heavy snow cover, the albedo of weather stations in the pine-forested areas from Europe to Siberia and in the Americas rarely goes above 40%, and many stations in this area have averages around 25%. Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50's in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world.


Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view.

If the theory of global warming is true, and the polar regions of the planet are going to be rapidly warming up, then the magnitude and path of the warming trend will depend largely on the albedo of the earth's polar regions, and to a lesser extent on the albedo of the whole planet. Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect. But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo. If the ice were to melt, the very high-albedo ice would be replaced with some very low-albedo water, and temperatures would rise enormously, perhaps as much as 15&amp;deg;F, which would make the area warmer than any other area at that latitude.

Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 81&amp;deg;F (this is the GHCN's record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 2&amp;deg;F per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 41&amp;deg;F, which is much warmer than the approximately 20&amp;deg;F that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the [[Hawaii]]an [[volcano]] [[Mauna Loa]], which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 40&amp;deg;F, despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.

But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is 14&amp;deg;F, which reduced to sea level at a rate of 2&amp;deg;F gives 42&amp;deg;F, which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 74&amp;deg;F, and it is during the dry season a dry 77&amp;deg;F, so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.

The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70&amp;deg;N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 55&amp;deg;F. Given a lapse rate of 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 35&amp;deg;F. In fact, 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only 10&amp;deg;F, and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only 2&amp;deg;F. June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 2&amp;deg;F lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland's ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet lapse rate.

Svalbard is a group of islands extending from about 75&amp;deg;N to 80&amp;deg;N in the very warmest part of the Arctic Ocean, the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as 19&amp;deg;F at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about &amp;#8211;20&amp;deg;F but have fallen as low as &amp;#8211;70&amp;deg;F. This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.


Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above. The temperature of the purest Arctic Ocean water is roughly 28&amp;deg;F at all depths, in all seasons. The temperature of the ice above, however, is much colder because it reflects away some of the heat of the water below it. During the summertime, the upward face of the ice reflects away solar heat and prevents itself from melting completely. The ice that does melt helps keep the average July temperatures at the North Pole at about 31&amp;deg;F.



Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than if they wear white clothes. Ironically, dark skin also serves to aggravate heat loss during the hot summer months, although the human body's blood circulation is much more powerful than the albedo effect of its skin. Thus children, much skinnier than adults, need more clothes in the wintertime to keep them warm, even if they are dark-skinned. 




There is a simple relationship between the albedo of an area of the earth's surface and its color. The lighter the color, the higher the albedo. A white substance would have an albedo of 1.00, or 100%, while a black substance would have an albedo of 0.00 or 0%. The human eye perceives green light especially well, so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think. For example, the albedo of a pine forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. The ocean, because it is so deep, is even lower, at about 3.5% (the surface temperature of the ocean at the equator is allegedly over 100&amp;deg;F). Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. All of these measurements were taken from Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N, but with different values for latitude and day, they would be different. The reason for this is not because of the amount of sunlight coming in, which does not change a substance's albedo, but because the actual environments would be different in summer. For example, a cultivated field may come in as high as the low 20s, depending on the crop being cultivated. Because of increased photosynthesis, all of the values for the forests and swamp lands are nearly doubled in the summer. The grassy field, however, remains at 20% regardless of season or latitude. Near the equator, particularly in rainforest areas, the soil is very black, and its albedo is very close to 0. Some shallow lakes may have albedos as high as 45% during times when the sun is striking the lake from a very acute angle, and more of its light is reflected. Alpine areas often have strange albedo values because of the unusual land formations. 

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 

Snow is the greatest source of albedo in the world, with an albedo that can be as high as 98%. This is for the ideal example, however: deep snow over a treeless landscape with no obstacles around. In the real world, the maximum albedo depends on the environment. Thus, even in the middle of winter with a heavy snow cover, the albedo of weather stations in the pine-forested areas from Europe to Siberia and in the Americas rarely goes above 40%, and many stations in this area have averages around 25%. Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50's in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world.


Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that the earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 20&amp;deg;F colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place.

If the theory of global warming is true, and the polar regions of the planet are going to be rapidly warming up, then the magnitude and path of the warming trend will depend largely on the albedo of the earth's polar regions, and to a lesser extent on the albedo of the whole planet. Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect. But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo. If the ice were to melt, the very high-albedo ice would be replaced with some very low-albedo water, and temperatures would rise enormously, perhaps as much as 15&amp;deg;F, which would make the area warmer than any other area at that latitude. (This is what accounts for the unusually warm summers on the islands of Svalbard, in Norway. But Svalbard is surrounded by ocean, whereas the Davis Strait is surrounded by land, and thus has the potential to become even warmer than Svalbard.)

If the ice melted, then there would be a way for the warm waters of the Gulf Stream to penetrate deep into the Arctic, and warm spells would become increasingly frequent. This could accelerate the melting of the Arctic Ocean, a process which would feed on itself. A melted Arctic would help many people living in Arctic areas, but could possibly hurt many others living in other parts of the globe. 


In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old Soviet plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again. Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about 31&amp;deg;F, and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 42&amp;deg;F.)


Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about &amp;#8211;240&amp;deg;F. This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 9&amp;deg;F temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, all we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

Other scientists, noting the effect of volcanic eruptions on global temperatures, have suggested other ideas, some of which are actually practical, to stop global warming by increasing the earth's albedo. While all of these solutions are expensive and would require cooperation from powerful nations, they show that the problem of global warming is not much of a problem at all, that it can be easily controlled and eliminated by human technology. 

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 13&amp;deg;F during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.</text>

'''Albedo''' is a measure of the tendency of a surface to absorb and re-emit incoming [[radiation]], and thus lower its own [[temperature]]. Its value ranges from 0% for an object that absorbs all radiation to 100% for an object that reflects all radiation. Every [[molecule]] of every substance has its own albedo, but albedo can also refer to a collection of very many objects, and can even be applied to objects of a very large scale, such as the planet [[Earth]], which has an albedo of 37-39%.

Since albedo can greatly affect the temperature of an area, it is advantageous for people, especially in cold climates, to settle in areas where the albedo is very low, so that they can get as much warmth as possible from the [[sun]]. The reverse is true in [[desert]] and [[tropic|tropical]] climates; people want to live in areas where as much solar radiation as possible will be emitted back into space. According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 5&amp;deg;F warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. To give another example, the entire nation of [[Belgium]], which is among the most urbanized in the world, is considerably warmer than the mostly open, unforested [[France|French]] countryside that lies to its immediate southwest, perhaps also because of albedo effects.

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is acually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 5&amp;deg;F year-round. The difference would most likely be more than 30&amp;deg;F if the landscape of the rainforest was [[white]] instead of dark [[green]]. As evidence for this theory, scientists have climbed to the top of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in [[Tanzania]], which is located in an area well described as &quot;steaming jungle&quot;. But Kilimanjaro's temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level. Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 81&amp;deg;F (this is the GHCN's record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 2&amp;deg;F per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 41&amp;deg;F, which is much warmer than the approximately 20&amp;deg;F that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the [[Hawaii]]an [[volcano]] [[Mauna Loa]], which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 40&amp;deg;F, despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.

But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is 14&amp;deg;F, which reduced to sea level at a rate of 2&amp;deg;F gives 42&amp;deg;F, which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 74&amp;deg;F, and it is during the dry season a dry 77&amp;deg;F, so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.

The only possible explanation is that on Kilimanjaro, a glacier built up when the climate was colder, and that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat to keep itself cold enough not to melt, and to keep the air temperature at the summit much lower than that atop Mauna Loa. This very wide gap in temperatures, of nearly 20&amp;deg;F, occurs despite the fact that the skies above both mountains are very cloudy and the climate of both is very wet, so not much solar radiation reaches either summit. If Mauna Loa were completely dry, it could be expected that its temperature would be even warmer, perhaps as warm as that of Tibet at 14,000 feet in summer.

Another good example of albedo in action is Greenland. Greenland is an island covered almost completely with ice. In the winter, very little sunlight reaches Greenland, so albedo is not as important. But in the summertime, it makes a very big difference, making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally be for a given latitude and elevation. For example, Eismitte is a weather station situated a bit south of the geographical center of the island (near 70&amp;deg;N) at an altitude of 9843 feet. The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70&amp;deg;N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 55&amp;deg;F. Given a lapse rate of 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 35&amp;deg;F. In fact, 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only 10&amp;deg;F, and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only 2&amp;deg;F. June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 2&amp;deg;F lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland's ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet lapse rate.

In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as 19&amp;deg;F at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about -20&amp;deg;F but have fallen as low as -70&amp;deg;F. This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.

Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above.

Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 81&amp;deg;F (this is the GHCN's record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 2&amp;deg;F per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 41&amp;deg;F, which is much warmer than the approximately 20&amp;deg;F that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the [[Hawaii]]an [[volcano]] [[Mauna Loa]], which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 40&amp;deg;F, despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.

But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is 14&amp;deg;F, which reduced to sea level at a rate of 2&amp;deg;F gives 42&amp;deg;F, which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 74&amp;deg;F, and it is during the dry season a dry 77&amp;deg;F, so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.

The only possible explanation is that on Kilimanjaro, a glacier built up when the climate was colder, and that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat to keep itself cold enough not to melt, and to keep the air temperature at the summit much lower than that atop Mauna Loa. This very wide gap in temperatures, of nearly 20&amp;deg;F, occurs despite the fact that the skies above both mountains are very cloudy and the climate of both is very wet, so not much solar radiation reaches either summit. If Mauna Loa were completely dry, it could be expected that its temperature would be even warmer, perhaps as warm as that of Tibet at 14,000 feet in summer.

Another good example of albedo in action is Greenland. Greenland is an island covered almost completely with ice. In the winter, very little sunlight reaches Greenland, so albedo is not as important. But in the summertime, it makes a very big difference, making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally be for a given latitude and elevation. For example, Eismitte is a weather station situated a bit south of the geographical center of the island (near 70&amp;deg;N) at an altitude of 9843 feet. The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70&amp;deg;N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 55&amp;deg;F. Given a lapse rate of 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 35&amp;deg;F. In fact, 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only 10&amp;deg;F, and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only 2&amp;deg;F. June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 2&amp;deg;F lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland's ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet lapse rate.

Svalbard is a group of islands extending from about 75&amp;deg;N to 80&amp;deg;N in the very warmest part of the Arctic Ocean, the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as 19&amp;deg;F at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about -20&amp;deg;F but have fallen as low as -70&amp;deg;F. This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.

Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above. The temperature of the purest Arctic Ocean water is roughly 28&amp;deg;F at all depths, in all seasons. The temperature of the ice above, however, is much colder because it reflects away some of the heat of the water below it. During the summertime, the upward face of the ice reflects away solar heat and prevents itself from melting completely. The ice that does melt helps keep the average July temperatures at the North Pole at about 31&amp;deg;F.

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than if they wear white clothes. Ironically, dark skin also serves to aggravate heat loss during the hot summer months, although the human body's blood circulation is much more powerful than the albedo effect of its skin. Thus children, much skinnier than adults, need more clothes in the wintertime to keep them warm, even if they are dark-skinned. 

There is a simple relationship between the albedo of an area of the earth's surface and its color. The lighter the color, the higher the albedo. A white substance would have an albedo of 1.00, or 100%, while a black substance would have an albedo of 0.00 or 0%. The human eye perceives green light especially well, so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think. For example, the albedo of a pine forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. The ocean, because it is so deep, is even lower, at about 3.5% (the surface temperature of the ocean at the equator is allegedly over 100&amp;deg;F). Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. All of these measurements were taken from Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N, but with different values for latitude and day, they would be different. The reason for this is not because of the amount of sunlight coming in, which does not change a substance's albedo, but because the actual environments would be different in summer. For example, a cultivated field may come in as high as the low 20s, depending on the crop being cultivated. Because of increased photosynthesis, all of the values for the forests and swamp lands are nearly doubled in the summer. The grassy field, however, remains at 20% regardless of season or latitude. Near the equator, particularly in rainforest areas, the soil is very black, and its albedo is very close to 0. Some shallow lakes may have albedos as high as 45% during times when the sun is striking the lake from a very acute angle, and more of its light is reflected. Alpine areas often have strange albedo values because of the unusual land formations. 

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 

Snow is the greatest source of albedo in the world, with an albedo that can be as high as 98%. This is for the ideal example, however: deep snow over a treeless landscape with no obstacles around. In the real world, the maximum albedo depends on the environment. Thus, even in the middle of winter with a heavy snow cover, the albedo of weather stations in the pine-forested areas from Europe to Siberia and in the Americas rarely goes above 40%, and many stations in this area have averages around 25%. Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50's in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world.


Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that the earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 20&amp;deg;F colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place.

If the theory of global warming is true, and the polar regions of the planet are going to be rapidly warming up, then the magnitude and path of the warming trend will depend largely on the albedo of the earth's polar regions, and to a lesser extent on the albedo of the whole planet. Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect. But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo. If the ice were to melt, the very high-albedo ice would be replaced with some very low-albedo water, and temperatures would rise enormously, perhaps as much as 15&amp;deg;F, which would make the area warmer than any other area at that latitude. (This is what accounts for the unusually warm summers on the islands of Svalbard, in Norway. But Svalbard is surrounded by ocean, whereas the Davis Strait is surrounded by land, and thus has the potential to become even warmer than Svalbard.)

If the ice melted, then there would be a way for the warm waters of the Gulf Stream to penetrate deep into the Arctic, and warm spells would become increasingly frequent. This could accelerate the melting of the Arctic Ocean, a process which would feed on itself. A melted Arctic would help many people living in Arctic areas, but could possibly hurt many others living in other parts of the globe. 

In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old Soviet plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again. Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about 31&amp;deg;F, and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 42&amp;deg;F.)

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -240&amp;deg;F. This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 9&amp;deg;F temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, all we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

Other scientists, noting the effect of volcanic eruptions on global temperatures, have suggested other ideas, some of which are actually practical, to stop global warming by increasing the earth's albedo. While all of these solutions are expensive and would require cooperation from powerful nations, they show that the problem of global warming is not much of a problem at all, that it can be easily controlled and eliminated by human technology. 

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 13&amp;deg;F during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.</text>

'''Albedo''' is a measure of the tendency of a surface to absorb and re-emit incoming [[radiation]], and thus lower its own [[temperature]]. Its value ranges from 0% (for an object which absorbs all radiation) to 100% (for an object which reflects all radiation). Powdered [[charcoal]] has a low albedo; whilst, a [[mirror]] has a relatively high albedo. The albedo of an object can be used to help determine it's [[chemical]] [[composition]]. Every [[molecule]] of every substance has its own albedo, but albedo can also refer to a collection of very many objects, and can even be applied to objects of a very large scale, such as the planet [[Earth]], which has an albedo of 37-39%. 

Since albedo can greatly affect the temperature of an area, it is advantageous for people, especially in cold climates, to settle in areas where the albedo is very low, so that they can get as much warmth as possible from the [[sun]]. The reverse is true in [[desert]] and [[tropic|tropical]] climates; people want to live in areas where as much solar radiation as possible will be emitted back into space. According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 5&amp;deg;F warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. To give another example, the entire nation of [[Belgium]], which is among the most urbanized in the world, is considerably warmer than the mostly open, unforested [[France|French]] countryside that lies to its immediate southwest, perhaps also because of albedo effects.

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is acually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 5&amp;deg;F year-round. The difference would most likely be more than 30&amp;deg;F if the landscape of the rainforest was [[white]] instead of dark [[green]]. As evidence for this theory, scientists have climbed to the top of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in [[Tanzania]], which is located in an area well described as &quot;steaming jungle&quot;. But Kilimanjaro's temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level. Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 81&amp;deg;F (this is the GHCN's record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 2&amp;deg;F per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 41&amp;deg;F, which is much warmer than the approximately 20&amp;deg;F that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the [[Hawaii]]an [[volcano]] [[Mauna Loa]], which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 40&amp;deg;F, despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.

But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is 14&amp;deg;F, which reduced to sea level at a rate of 2&amp;deg;F gives 42&amp;deg;F, which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 74&amp;deg;F, and it is during the dry season a dry 77&amp;deg;F, so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.

The only possible explanation is that on Kilimanjaro, a glacier built up when the climate was colder, and that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat to keep itself cold enough not to melt, and to keep the air temperature at the summit much lower than that atop Mauna Loa. This very wide gap in temperatures, of nearly 20&amp;deg;F, occurs despite the fact that the skies above both mountains are very cloudy and the climate of both is very wet, so not much solar radiation reaches either summit. If Mauna Loa were completely dry, it could be expected that its temperature would be even warmer, perhaps as warm as that of Tibet at 14,000 feet in summer.

Another good example of albedo in action is Greenland. Greenland is an island covered almost completely with ice. In the winter, very little sunlight reaches Greenland, so albedo is not as important. But in the summertime, it makes a very big difference, making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally be for a given latitude and elevation. For example, Eismitte is a weather station situated a bit south of the geographical center of the island (near 70&amp;deg;N) at an altitude of 9843 feet. The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70&amp;deg;N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 55&amp;deg;F. Given a lapse rate of 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 35&amp;deg;F. In fact, 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only 10&amp;deg;F, and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only 2&amp;deg;F. June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 2&amp;deg;F lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland's ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 2&amp;deg;F per 1000 feet lapse rate.

Svalbard is a group of islands extending from about 75&amp;deg;N to 80&amp;deg;N in the very warmest part of the Arctic Ocean, the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as 19&amp;deg;F at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about -20&amp;deg;F but have fallen as low as -70&amp;deg;F. This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.

Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above. The temperature of the purest Arctic Ocean water is roughly 28&amp;deg;F at all depths, in all seasons. The temperature of the ice above, however, is much colder because it reflects away some of the heat of the water below it. During the summertime, the upward face of the ice reflects away solar heat and prevents itself from melting completely. The ice that does melt helps keep the average July temperatures at the North Pole at about 31&amp;deg;F.

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than if they wear white clothes. Ironically, dark skin also serves to aggravate heat loss during the hot summer months, although the human body's blood circulation is much more powerful than the albedo effect of its skin. Thus children, much skinnier than adults, need more clothes in the wintertime to keep them warm, even if they are dark-skinned. 

There is a simple relationship between the albedo of an area of the earth's surface and its color. The lighter the color, the higher the albedo. A white substance would have an albedo of 1.00, or 100%, while a black substance would have an albedo of 0.00 or 0%. The human eye perceives green light especially well, so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think. For example, the albedo of a pine forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. The ocean, because it is so deep, is even lower, at about 3.5% (the surface temperature of the ocean at the equator is allegedly over 100&amp;deg;F). Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. All of these measurements were taken from Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N, but with different values for latitude and day, they would be different. The reason for this is not because of the amount of sunlight coming in, which does not change a substance's albedo, but because the actual environments would be different in summer. For example, a cultivated field may come in as high as the low 20s, depending on the crop being cultivated. Because of increased photosynthesis, all of the values for the forests and swamp lands are nearly doubled in the summer. The grassy field, however, remains at 20% regardless of season or latitude. Near the equator, particularly in rainforest areas, the soil is very black, and its albedo is very close to 0. Some shallow lakes may have albedos as high as 45% during times when the sun is striking the lake from a very acute angle, and more of its light is reflected. Alpine areas often have strange albedo values because of the unusual land formations. 

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 

Snow is the greatest source of albedo in the world, with an albedo that can be as high as 98%. This is for the ideal example, however: deep snow over a treeless landscape with no obstacles around. In the real world, the maximum albedo depends on the environment. Thus, even in the middle of winter with a heavy snow cover, the albedo of weather stations in the pine-forested areas from Europe to Siberia and in the Americas rarely goes above 40%, and many stations in this area have averages around 25%. Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50's in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world.


Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that the earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 20&amp;deg;F colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place.

If the theory of global warming is true, and the polar regions of the planet are going to be rapidly warming up, then the magnitude and path of the warming trend will depend largely on the albedo of the earth's polar regions, and to a lesser extent on the albedo of the whole planet. Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect. But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo. If the ice were to melt, the very high-albedo ice would be replaced with some very low-albedo water, and temperatures would rise enormously, perhaps as much as 15&amp;deg;F, which would make the area warmer than any other area at that latitude. (This is what accounts for the unusually warm summers on the islands of Svalbard, in Norway. But Svalbard is surrounded by ocean, whereas the Davis Strait is surrounded by land, and thus has the potential to become even warmer than Svalbard.)

If the ice melted, then there would be a way for the warm waters of the Gulf Stream to penetrate deep into the Arctic, and warm spells would become increasingly frequent. This could accelerate the melting of the Arctic Ocean, a process which would feed on itself. A melted Arctic would help many people living in Arctic areas, but could possibly hurt many others living in other parts of the globe. 

In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old Soviet plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again. Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about 31&amp;deg;F, and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 42&amp;deg;F.)

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -240&amp;deg;F. This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 9&amp;deg;F temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, all we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

Other scientists, noting the effect of volcanic eruptions on global temperatures, have suggested other ideas, some of which are actually practical, to stop global warming by increasing the earth's albedo. While all of these solutions are expensive and would require cooperation from powerful nations, they show that the problem of global warming is not much of a problem at all, that it can be easily controlled and eliminated by human technology. 

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 13&amp;deg;F during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.</text>

'''Albedo''' is a measure of the tendency of a surface to absorb and re-emit incoming [[radiation]], and thus lower its own [[temperature]]. Its value ranges from 0% (for an object which absorbs all radiation) to 100% (for an object which reflects all radiation). Powdered [[charcoal]] has a low albedo; whilst, a [[mirror]] has a relatively high albedo. The albedo of an object can be used to help determine it's [[chemical]] [[composition]]. Every [[molecule]] of every substance has its own albedo, but albedo can also refer to a collection of very many objects, and can even be applied to objects of a very large scale, such as the planet [[Earth]], which has an albedo of 37-39%. 

Since albedo can greatly affect the temperature of an area, it is advantageous for people, especially in cold climates, to settle in areas where the albedo is very low, so that they can get as much warmth as possible from the [[sun]]. The reverse is true in [[desert]] and [[tropic|tropical]] climates; people want to live in areas where as much solar radiation as possible will be emitted back into space. According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. To give another example, the entire nation of [[Belgium]], which is among the most urbanized in the world, is considerably warmer than the mostly open, unforested [[France|French]] countryside that lies to its immediate southwest, perhaps also because of albedo effects.

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is acually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) year-round. The difference would most likely be more than 17&amp;deg;C (30&amp;deg;F) if the landscape of the rainforest was [[white]] instead of dark [[green]]. As evidence for this theory, scientists have climbed to the top of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in [[Tanzania]], which is located in an area well described as &quot;steaming jungle&quot;. But Kilimanjaro's temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level. Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 27&amp;deg;C (81&amp;deg;F) (this is the GHCN's record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 5&amp;deg;C (41&amp;deg;F), which is much warmer than the approximately -7&amp;deg;C (20&amp;deg;F) that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the [[Hawaii]]an [[volcano]] [[Mauna Loa]], which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 4&amp;deg;C (40&amp;deg;F), despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.

But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is -10&amp;deg;C (14&amp;deg;F), which reduced to sea level at a rate of 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) gives 6&amp;deg;C (42&amp;deg;F), which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 23&amp;deg;C (74&amp;deg;F), and it is during the dry season a dry 25&amp;deg;C (77&amp;deg;F), so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.

The only possible explanation is that on Kilimanjaro, a glacier built up when the climate was colder, and that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat to keep itself cold enough not to melt, and to keep the air temperature at the summit much lower than that atop Mauna Loa. This very wide gap in temperatures, of nearly 11&amp;deg;C (20&amp;deg;F), occurs despite the fact that the skies above both mountains are very cloudy and the climate of both is very wet, so not much solar radiation reaches either summit. If Mauna Loa were completely dry, it could be expected that its temperature would be even warmer, perhaps as warm as that of Tibet at 14,000 feet in summer.

Another good example of albedo in action is Greenland. Greenland is an island covered almost completely with ice. In the winter, very little sunlight reaches Greenland, so albedo is not as important. But in the summertime, it makes a very big difference, making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally be for a given latitude and elevation. For example, Eismitte is a weather station situated a bit south of the geographical center of the island (near 70&amp;deg;N) at an altitude of 9843 feet. The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70&amp;deg;N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 13&amp;deg;C (55&amp;deg;F). Given a lapse rate of 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 2&amp;deg;C (35&amp;deg;F). In fact, 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only -12&amp;deg;C (10&amp;deg;F), and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only -17&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F). June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland's ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 1.1 or -17&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1000 feet lapse rate.

Svalbard is a group of islands extending from about 75&amp;deg;N to 80&amp;deg;N in the very warmest part of the Arctic Ocean, the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as -7&amp;deg;C (19&amp;deg;F) at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about -29&amp;deg;C (-20&amp;deg;F) but have fallen as low as -57&amp;deg;C (-70&amp;deg;F). This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.

Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above. The temperature of the purest Arctic Ocean water is roughly -2&amp;deg;C (28&amp;deg;F) at all depths, in all seasons. The temperature of the ice above, however, is much colder because it reflects away some of the heat of the water below it. During the summertime, the upward face of the ice reflects away solar heat and prevents itself from melting completely. The ice that does melt helps keep the average July temperatures at the North Pole at about -1&amp;deg;C (31&amp;deg;F).

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than if they wear white clothes. Ironically, dark skin also serves to aggravate heat loss during the hot summer months, although the human body's blood circulation is much more powerful than the albedo effect of its skin. Thus children, much skinnier than adults, need more clothes in the wintertime to keep them warm, even if they are dark-skinned. 

There is a simple relationship between the albedo of an area of the earth's surface and its color. The lighter the color, the higher the albedo. A white substance would have an albedo of 1.00, or 100%, while a black substance would have an albedo of 0.00 or 0%. The human eye perceives green light especially well, so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think. For example, the albedo of a pine forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. The ocean, because it is so deep, is even lower, at about 3.5% (the surface temperature of the ocean at the equator is allegedly over 38&amp;deg;C (100&amp;deg;F)). Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. All of these measurements were taken from Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N, but with different values for latitude and day, they would be different. The reason for this is not because of the amount of sunlight coming in, which does not change a substance's albedo, but because the actual environments would be different in summer. For example, a cultivated field may come in as high as the low 20s, depending on the crop being cultivated. Because of increased photosynthesis, all of the values for the forests and swamp lands are nearly doubled in the summer. The grassy field, however, remains at 20% regardless of season or latitude. Near the equator, particularly in rainforest areas, the soil is very black, and its albedo is very close to 0. Some shallow lakes may have albedos as high as 45% during times when the sun is striking the lake from a very acute angle, and more of its light is reflected. Alpine areas often have strange albedo values because of the unusual land formations. 

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 

Snow is the greatest source of albedo in the world, with an albedo that can be as high as 98%. This is for the ideal example, however: deep snow over a treeless landscape with no obstacles around. In the real world, the maximum albedo depends on the environment. Thus, even in the middle of winter with a heavy snow cover, the albedo of weather stations in the pine-forested areas from Europe to Siberia and in the Americas rarely goes above 40%, and many stations in this area have averages around 25%. Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50's in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world.


Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that the earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 11&amp;deg;C (20&amp;deg;F) colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place.

If the theory of global warming is true, and the polar regions of the planet are going to be rapidly warming up, then the magnitude and path of the warming trend will depend largely on the albedo of the earth's polar regions, and to a lesser extent on the albedo of the whole planet. Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect. But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo. If the ice were to melt, the very high-albedo ice would be replaced with some very low-albedo water, and temperatures would rise enormously, perhaps as much as 8&amp;deg;C (15&amp;deg;F), which would make the area warmer than any other area at that latitude. (This is what accounts for the unusually warm summers on the islands of Svalbard, in Norway. But Svalbard is surrounded by ocean, whereas the Davis Strait is surrounded by land, and thus has the potential to become even warmer than Svalbard.)

If the ice melted, then there would be a way for the warm waters of the Gulf Stream to penetrate deep into the Arctic, and warm spells would become increasingly frequent. This could accelerate the melting of the Arctic Ocean, a process which would feed on itself. A melted Arctic would help many people living in Arctic areas, but could possibly hurt many others living in other parts of the globe. 

In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old Soviet plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again. Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about -1&amp;deg;C (31&amp;deg;F), and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 6&amp;deg;C (42&amp;deg;F).)

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -151&amp;deg;C (-240&amp;deg;F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5.0&amp;deg;C (9&amp;deg;F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, all we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

Other scientists, noting the effect of volcanic eruptions on global temperatures, have suggested other ideas, some of which are actually practical, to stop global warming by increasing the earth's albedo. While all of these solutions are expensive and would require cooperation from powerful nations, they show that the problem of global warming is not much of a problem at all, that it can be easily controlled and eliminated by human technology. 

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 7&amp;deg;C (13&amp;deg;F) during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.</text>

The difference would most likely be more than 17&amp;deg;C (30&amp;deg;F) if the landscape of the rainforest was [[white]] instead of dark [[green]]. As evidence for this theory, scientists have climbed to the top of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in [[Tanzania]], which is located in an area well described as &quot;steaming jungle&quot;. But Kilimanjaro's temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level. Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 27&amp;deg;C (81&amp;deg;F) (this is the GHCN's record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 5&amp;deg;C (41&amp;deg;F), which is much warmer than the approximately -7&amp;deg;C (20&amp;deg;F) that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the [[Hawaii]]an [[volcano]] [[Mauna Loa]], which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 4&amp;deg;C (40&amp;deg;F), despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.

But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is -10&amp;deg;C (14&amp;deg;F), which reduced to sea level at a rate of 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) gives 6&amp;deg;C (42&amp;deg;F), which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 23&amp;deg;C (74&amp;deg;F), and it is during the dry season a dry 25&amp;deg;C (77&amp;deg;F), so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.

The only possible explanation is that on Kilimanjaro, a glacier built up when the climate was colder, and that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat to keep itself cold enough not to melt, and to keep the air temperature at the summit much lower than that atop Mauna Loa. This very wide gap in temperatures, of nearly 11&amp;deg;C (20&amp;deg;F), occurs despite the fact that the skies above both mountains are very cloudy and the climate of both is very wet, so not much solar radiation reaches either summit. If Mauna Loa were completely dry, it could be expected that its temperature would be even warmer, perhaps as warm as that of Tibet at 14,000 feet in summer.

The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70&amp;deg;N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 13&amp;deg;C (55&amp;deg;F). Given a lapse rate of 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 2&amp;deg;C (35&amp;deg;F). In fact, 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only -12&amp;deg;C (10&amp;deg;F), and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only -17&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F). June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) lapse rate.

Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above. The temperature of the purest Arctic Ocean water is roughly -2&amp;deg;C (28&amp;deg;F) at all depths, in all seasons. The temperature of the ice above, however, is much colder because it reflects away some of the heat of the water below it. During the summertime, the upward face of the ice reflects away solar heat and prevents itself from melting completely. The ice that does melt helps keep the average July temperatures at the North Pole at about -1&amp;deg;C (31&amp;deg;F).

Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50's in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world.

But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 11&amp;deg;C (20&amp;deg;F) colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place.

If the theory of global warming is true, and the polar regions of the planet are going to be rapidly warming up, then the magnitude and path of the warming trend will depend largely on the albedo of the earth's polar regions, and to a lesser extent on the albedo of the whole planet. Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect. But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo. If the ice were to melt, the very high-albedo ice would be replaced with some very low-albedo water, and temperatures would rise enormously, perhaps as much as 8&amp;deg;C (15&amp;deg;F), which would make the area warmer than any other area at that latitude. (This is what accounts for the unusually warm summers on the islands of Svalbard, in Norway. But Svalbard is surrounded by ocean, whereas the Davis Strait is surrounded by land, and thus has the potential to become even warmer than Svalbard.)

If the ice melted, then there would be a way for the warm waters of the Gulf Stream to penetrate deep into the Arctic, and warm spells would become increasingly frequent. This could accelerate the melting of the Arctic Ocean, a process which would feed on itself. A melted Arctic would help many people living in Arctic areas, but could possibly hurt many others living in other parts of the globe. 

In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old Soviet plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again. Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about -1&amp;deg;C (31&amp;deg;F), and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 6&amp;deg;C (42&amp;deg;F).)

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -151&amp;deg;C (-240&amp;deg;F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5.0&amp;deg;C (9&amp;deg;F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, all we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

Other scientists, noting the effect of volcanic eruptions on global temperatures, have suggested other ideas, some of which are actually practical, to stop global warming by increasing the earth's albedo. While all of these solutions are expensive and would require cooperation from powerful nations, they show that the problem of global warming is not much of a problem at all, that it can be easily controlled and eliminated by human technology. 

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 7&amp;deg;C (13&amp;deg;F) during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[de:Albedo]] [[fr:Albédo]]

'''Albedo''' is a measure of the tendency of a surface to absorb and re-emit incoming [[radiation]], and thus lower its own [[temperature]]. Its value ranges from 0% (for an object which absorbs all radiation) to 100% (for an object which reflects all radiation). Powdered [[charcoal]] has a low albedo; whilst, a [[mirror]] has a relatively high albedo. The albedo of an object can be used to help determine it's [[chemical]] [[composition]]. Every [[molecule]] of every substance has its own albedo, but albedo can also refer to a collection of very many objects, and can even be applied to objects of a very large scale, such as the planet [[Earth]], which has an albedo of 37-39%. 

Since albedo can greatly affect the temperature of an area, it is advantageous for people, especially in cold climates, to settle in areas where the albedo is very low, so that they can get as much warmth as possible from the [[sun]]. The reverse is true in [[desert]] and [[tropic|tropical]] climates; people want to live in areas where as much solar radiation as possible will be emitted back into space. According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. To give another example, the entire nation of [[Belgium]], which is among the most urbanized in the world, is considerably warmer than the mostly open, unforested [[France|French]] countryside that lies to its immediate southwest, perhaps also because of albedo effects.

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is acually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) year-round. The difference would most likely be more than 17&amp;deg;C (30&amp;deg;F) if the landscape of the rainforest was [[white]] instead of dark [[green]]. As evidence for this theory, scientists have climbed to the top of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in [[Tanzania]], which is located in an area well described as &quot;steaming jungle&quot;. But Kilimanjaro's temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level. Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 27&amp;deg;C (81&amp;deg;F) (this is the GHCN's record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 5&amp;deg;C (41&amp;deg;F), which is much warmer than the approximately -7&amp;deg;C (20&amp;deg;F) that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the [[Hawaii]]an [[volcano]] [[Mauna Loa]], which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 4&amp;deg;C (40&amp;deg;F), despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.

But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is -10&amp;deg;C (14&amp;deg;F), which reduced to sea level at a rate of 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) gives 6&amp;deg;C (42&amp;deg;F), which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 23&amp;deg;C (74&amp;deg;F), and it is during the dry season a dry 25&amp;deg;C (77&amp;deg;F), so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.

The only possible explanation is that on Kilimanjaro, a glacier built up when the climate was colder, and that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat to keep itself cold enough not to melt, and to keep the air temperature at the summit much lower than that atop Mauna Loa. This very wide gap in temperatures, of nearly 11&amp;deg;C (20&amp;deg;F), occurs despite the fact that the skies above both mountains are very cloudy and the climate of both is very wet, so not much solar radiation reaches either summit. If Mauna Loa were completely dry, it could be expected that its temperature would be even warmer, perhaps as warm as that of Tibet at 14,000 feet in summer.

Another good example of albedo in action is Greenland. Greenland is an island covered almost completely with ice. In the winter, very little sunlight reaches Greenland, so albedo is not as important. But in the summertime, it makes a very big difference, making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally be for a given latitude and elevation. For example, Eismitte is a weather station situated a bit south of the geographical center of the island (near 70&amp;deg;N) at an altitude of 9843 feet. The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70&amp;deg;N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 13&amp;deg;C (55&amp;deg;F). Given a lapse rate of 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 2&amp;deg;C (35&amp;deg;F). In fact, 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only -12&amp;deg;C (10&amp;deg;F), and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only -17&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F). June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland's ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1000 feet lapse rate.

Svalbard is a group of islands extending from about 75&amp;deg;N to 80&amp;deg;N in the very warmest part of the Arctic Ocean, the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as -7&amp;deg;C (19&amp;deg;F) at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about -29&amp;deg;C (-20&amp;deg;F) but have fallen as low as -57&amp;deg;C (-70&amp;deg;F). This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.

Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above. The temperature of the purest Arctic Ocean water is roughly -2&amp;deg;C (28&amp;deg;F) at all depths, in all seasons. The temperature of the ice above, however, is much colder because it reflects away some of the heat of the water below it. During the summertime, the upward face of the ice reflects away solar heat and prevents itself from melting completely. The ice that does melt helps keep the average July temperatures at the North Pole at about -1&amp;deg;C (31&amp;deg;F).

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than if they wear white clothes. Ironically, dark skin also serves to aggravate heat loss during the hot summer months, although the human body's blood circulation is much more powerful than the albedo effect of its skin. Thus children, much skinnier than adults, need more clothes in the wintertime to keep them warm, even if they are dark-skinned. 

There is a simple relationship between the albedo of an area of the earth's surface and its color. The lighter the color, the higher the albedo. A white substance would have an albedo of 1.00, or 100%, while a black substance would have an albedo of 0.00 or 0%. The human eye perceives green light especially well, so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think. For example, the albedo of a pine forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. The ocean, because it is so deep, is even lower, at about 3.5% (the surface temperature of the ocean at the equator is allegedly over 38&amp;deg;C (100&amp;deg;F)). Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. All of these measurements were taken from Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N, but with different values for latitude and day, they would be different. The reason for this is not because of the amount of sunlight coming in, which does not change a substance's albedo, but because the actual environments would be different in summer. For example, a cultivated field may come in as high as the low 20s, depending on the crop being cultivated. Because of increased photosynthesis, all of the values for the forests and swamp lands are nearly doubled in the summer. The grassy field, however, remains at 20% regardless of season or latitude. Near the equator, particularly in rainforest areas, the soil is very black, and its albedo is very close to 0. Some shallow lakes may have albedos as high as 45% during times when the sun is striking the lake from a very acute angle, and more of its light is reflected. Alpine areas often have strange albedo values because of the unusual land formations. 

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 

Snow is the greatest source of albedo in the world, with an albedo that can be as high as 98%. This is for the ideal example, however: deep snow over a treeless landscape with no obstacles around. In the real world, the maximum albedo depends on the environment. Thus, even in the middle of winter with a heavy snow cover, the albedo of weather stations in the pine-forested areas from Europe to Siberia and in the Americas rarely goes above 40%, and many stations in this area have averages around 25%. Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50's in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world.


Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that the earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 11&amp;deg;C (20&amp;deg;F) colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place.

If the theory of global warming is true, and the polar regions of the planet are going to be rapidly warming up, then the magnitude and path of the warming trend will depend largely on the albedo of the earth's polar regions, and to a lesser extent on the albedo of the whole planet. Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect. But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo. If the ice were to melt, the very high-albedo ice would be replaced with some very low-albedo water, and temperatures would rise enormously, perhaps as much as 8&amp;deg;C (15&amp;deg;F), which would make the area warmer than any other area at that latitude. (This is what accounts for the unusually warm summers on the islands of Svalbard, in Norway. But Svalbard is surrounded by ocean, whereas the Davis Strait is surrounded by land, and thus has the potential to become even warmer than Svalbard.)

If the ice melted, then there would be a way for the warm waters of the Gulf Stream to penetrate deep into the Arctic, and warm spells would become increasingly frequent. This could accelerate the melting of the Arctic Ocean, a process which would feed on itself. A melted Arctic would help many people living in Arctic areas, but could possibly hurt many others living in other parts of the globe.

When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) year-round. The difference would most likely be more than 17&amp;deg;C (30&amp;deg;F) if the landscape of the rainforest was [[white]] instead of dark [[green]]. As evidence for this theory, scientists have climbed to the top of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in [[Tanzania]], which is located in an area well described as &quot;steaming jungle&quot;. But Kilimanjaro's temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level. Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 27&amp;deg;C (81&amp;deg;F) (this is the GHCN's record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 5&amp;deg;C (41&amp;deg;F), which is much warmer than the approximately -7&amp;deg;C (20&amp;deg;F) that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the [[Hawaii]]an [[volcano]] [[Mauna Loa]], which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 4&amp;deg;C (40&amp;deg;F), despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.

But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is -10&amp;deg;C (14&amp;deg;F), which reduced to sea level at a rate of 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) gives 6&amp;deg;C (42&amp;deg;F), which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 23&amp;deg;C (74&amp;deg;F), and it is during the dry season a dry 25&amp;deg;C (77&amp;deg;F), so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.

The only possible explanation is that on Kilimanjaro, a glacier built up when the climate was colder, and that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat to keep itself cold enough not to melt, and to keep the air temperature at the summit much lower than that atop Mauna Loa. This very wide gap in temperatures, of nearly 11&amp;deg;C (20&amp;deg;F), occurs despite the fact that the skies above both mountains are very cloudy and the climate of both is very wet, so not much solar radiation reaches either summit. If Mauna Loa were completely dry, it could be expected that its temperature would be even warmer, perhaps as warm as that of Tibet at 14,000 feet in summer.

Another good example of albedo in action is Greenland. Greenland is an island covered almost completely with ice. In the winter, very little sunlight reaches Greenland, so albedo is not as important. But in the summertime, it makes a very big difference, making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally be for a given latitude and elevation. For example, Eismitte is a weather station situated a bit south of the geographical center of the island (near 70&amp;deg;N) at an altitude of 9843 feet. The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70&amp;deg;N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 13&amp;deg;C (55&amp;deg;F). Given a lapse rate of 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 2&amp;deg;C (35&amp;deg;F). In fact, 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only -12&amp;deg;C (10&amp;deg;F), and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only -17&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F). June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland's ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1000 feet lapse rate.

Svalbard is a group of islands extending from about 75&amp;deg;N to 80&amp;deg;N in the very warmest part of the Arctic Ocean, the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as -7&amp;deg;C (19&amp;deg;F) at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about -29&amp;deg;C (-20&amp;deg;F) but have fallen as low as -57&amp;deg;C (-70&amp;deg;F). This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.

Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above. The temperature of the purest Arctic Ocean water is roughly -2&amp;deg;C (28&amp;deg;F) at all depths, in all seasons. The temperature of the ice above, however, is much colder because it reflects away some of the heat of the water below it. During the summertime, the upward face of the ice reflects away solar heat and prevents itself from melting completely. The ice that does melt helps keep the average July temperatures at the North Pole at about -1&amp;deg;C (31&amp;deg;F).

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than if they wear white clothes. Ironically, dark skin also serves to aggravate heat loss during the hot summer months, although the human body's blood circulation is much more powerful than the albedo effect of its skin. Thus children, much skinnier than adults, need more clothes in the wintertime to keep them warm, even if they are dark-skinned. 

There is a simple relationship between the albedo of an area of the earth's surface and its color. The lighter the color, the higher the albedo. A white substance would have an albedo of 1.00, or 100%, while a black substance would have an albedo of 0.00 or 0%. The human eye perceives green light especially well, so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think. For example, the albedo of a pine forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. The ocean, because it is so deep, is even lower, at about 3.5% (the surface temperature of the ocean at the equator is allegedly over 38&amp;deg;C (100&amp;deg;F)). Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. All of these measurements were taken from Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N, but with different values for latitude and day, they would be different. The reason for this is not because of the amount of sunlight coming in, which does not change a substance's albedo, but because the actual environments would be different in summer. For example, a cultivated field may come in as high as the low 20s, depending on the crop being cultivated. Because of increased photosynthesis, all of the values for the forests and swamp lands are nearly doubled in the summer. The grassy field, however, remains at 20% regardless of season or latitude. Near the equator, particularly in rainforest areas, the soil is very black, and its albedo is very close to 0. Some shallow lakes may have albedos as high as 45% during times when the sun is striking the lake from a very acute angle, and more of its light is reflected. Alpine areas often have strange albedo values because of the unusual land formations. 

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 

Snow is the greatest source of albedo in the world, with an albedo that can be as high as 98%. This is for the ideal example, however: deep snow over a treeless landscape with no obstacles around. In the real world, the maximum albedo depends on the environment. Thus, even in the middle of winter with a heavy snow cover, the albedo of weather stations in the pine-forested areas from Europe to Siberia and in the Americas rarely goes above 40%, and many stations in this area have averages around 25%. Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50's in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world.


Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that the earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 11&amp;deg;C (20&amp;deg;F) colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place.

If the theory of global warming is true, and the polar regions of the planet are going to be rapidly warming up, then the magnitude and path of the warming trend will depend largely on the albedo of the earth's polar regions, and to a lesser extent on the albedo of the whole planet. Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect. But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo. If the ice were to melt, the very high-albedo ice would be replaced with some very low-albedo water, and temperatures would rise enormously, perhaps as much as 8&amp;deg;C (15&amp;deg;F), which would make the area warmer than any other area at that latitude. (This is what accounts for the unusually warm summers on the islands of Svalbard, in Norway. But Svalbard is surrounded by ocean, whereas the Davis Strait is surrounded by land, and thus has the potential to become even warmer than Svalbard.)

If the ice melted, then there would be a way for the warm waters of the Gulf Stream to penetrate deep into the Arctic, and warm spells would become increasingly frequent. This could accelerate the melting of the Arctic Ocean, a process which would feed on itself. A melted Arctic would help many people living in Arctic areas, but could possibly hurt many others living in other parts of the globe. 

In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old Soviet plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again. Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about -1&amp;deg;C (31&amp;deg;F), and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 6&amp;deg;C (42&amp;deg;F).)

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -151&amp;deg;C (-240&amp;deg;F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5.0&amp;deg;C (9&amp;deg;F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, all we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

Other scientists, noting the effect of volcanic eruptions on global temperatures, have suggested other ideas, some of which are actually practical, to stop global warming by increasing the earth's albedo. While all of these solutions are expensive and would require cooperation from powerful nations, they show that the problem of global warming is not much of a problem at all, that it can be easily controlled and eliminated by human technology. 

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 7&amp;deg;C (13&amp;deg;F) during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[de:Albedo]] [[fr:Albédo]] [[es:Albedo]]

'''Albedo''' is a measure of the tendency of a surface to absorb and re-emit incoming [[radiation]], and thus lower its own [[temperature]]. Its value ranges from zero percent (for an object which absorbs all radiation) to 100 percent (for an object which reflects all radiation). Powdered [[charcoal]] has a low albedo; whilst, a [[mirror]] has a relatively high albedo. The albedo of an object can be used to help determine its [[chemical]] [[composition]]. Every [[molecule]] of every substance has its own albedo, but albedo can also refer to a collection of very many objects, and can even be applied to objects of a very large scale, such as the planet [[Earth]], which has an albedo of 37-39%. 

Since albedo can greatly affect the temperature of an area, it is advantageous for people, especially in cold climates, to settle in areas where the albedo is very low, so that they can get as much warmth as possible from the [[sun]]. The reverse is true in [[desert]] and [[tropic|tropical]] climates; people want to live in areas where as much solar radiation as possible will be emitted back into space. According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. To give another example, the entire nation of [[Belgium]], which is among the most urbanized in the world, is considerably warmer than the mostly open, unforested [[France|French]] countryside that lies to its immediate southwest, perhaps also because of albedo effects.

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is acually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) year-round. The difference would most likely be more than 17&amp;deg;C (30&amp;deg;F) if the landscape of the rainforest was [[white]] instead of dark [[green]]. As evidence for this theory, scientists have climbed to the top of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in [[Tanzania]], which is located in an area well described as &quot;steaming jungle&quot;. But Kilimanjaro's temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level. Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 27&amp;deg;C (81&amp;deg;F) (this is the GHCN's record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 5&amp;deg;C (41&amp;deg;F), which is much warmer than the approximately -7&amp;deg;C (20&amp;deg;F) that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the [[Hawaii]]an [[volcano]] [[Mauna Loa]], which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 4&amp;deg;C (40&amp;deg;F), despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.

But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is -10&amp;deg;C (14&amp;deg;F), which reduced to sea level at a rate of 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) gives 6&amp;deg;C (42&amp;deg;F), which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 23&amp;deg;C (74&amp;deg;F), and it is during the dry season a dry 25&amp;deg;C (77&amp;deg;F), so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.

The only possible explanation is that on Kilimanjaro, a glacier built up when the climate was colder, and that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat to keep itself cold enough not to melt, and to keep the air temperature at the summit much lower than that atop Mauna Loa. This very wide gap in temperatures, of nearly 11&amp;deg;C (20&amp;deg;F), occurs despite the fact that the skies above both mountains are very cloudy and the climate of both is very wet, so not much solar radiation reaches either summit. If Mauna Loa were completely dry, it could be expected that its temperature would be even warmer, perhaps as warm as that of Tibet at 14,000 feet in summer.

Another good example of albedo in action is Greenland. Greenland is an island covered almost completely with ice. In the winter, very little sunlight reaches Greenland, so albedo is not as important. But in the summertime, it makes a very big difference, making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally be for a given latitude and elevation. For example, Eismitte is a weather station situated a bit south of the geographical center of the island (near 70&amp;deg;N) at an altitude of 9843 feet. The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70&amp;deg;N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 13&amp;deg;C (55&amp;deg;F). Given a lapse rate of 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 2&amp;deg;C (35&amp;deg;F). In fact, 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only -12&amp;deg;C (10&amp;deg;F), and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only -17&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F). June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland's ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1000 feet lapse rate.

Svalbard is a group of islands extending from about 75&amp;deg;N to 80&amp;deg;N in the very warmest part of the Arctic Ocean, the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as -7&amp;deg;C (19&amp;deg;F) at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about -29&amp;deg;C (-20&amp;deg;F) but have fallen as low as -57&amp;deg;C (-70&amp;deg;F). This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.

Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above. The temperature of the purest Arctic Ocean water is roughly -2&amp;deg;C (28&amp;deg;F) at all depths, in all seasons. The temperature of the ice above, however, is much colder because it reflects away some of the heat of the water below it. During the summertime, the upward face of the ice reflects away solar heat and prevents itself from melting completely. The ice that does melt helps keep the average July temperatures at the North Pole at about -1&amp;deg;C (31&amp;deg;F).

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than if they wear white clothes. Ironically, dark skin also serves to aggravate heat loss during the hot summer months, although the human body's blood circulation is much more powerful than the albedo effect of its skin. Thus children, much skinnier than adults, need more clothes in the wintertime to keep them warm, even if they are dark-skinned. 

There is a simple relationship between the albedo of an area of the earth's surface and its color. The lighter the color, the higher the albedo. A white substance would have an albedo of 1.00, or 100%, while a black substance would have an albedo of 0.00 or 0%. The human eye perceives green light especially well, so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think. For example, the albedo of a pine forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. The ocean, because it is so deep, is even lower, at about 3.5% (the surface temperature of the ocean at the equator is allegedly over 38&amp;deg;C (100&amp;deg;F)). Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. All of these measurements were taken from Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N, but with different values for latitude and day, they would be different. The reason for this is not because of the amount of sunlight coming in, which does not change a substance's albedo, but because the actual environments would be different in summer. For example, a cultivated field may come in as high as the low 20s, depending on the crop being cultivated. Because of increased photosynthesis, all of the values for the forests and swamp lands are nearly doubled in the summer. The grassy field, however, remains at 20% regardless of season or latitude. Near the equator, particularly in rainforest areas, the soil is very black, and its albedo is very close to 0. Some shallow lakes may have albedos as high as 45% during times when the sun is striking the lake from a very acute angle, and more of its light is reflected. Alpine areas often have strange albedo values because of the unusual land formations. 

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 

Snow is the greatest source of albedo in the world, with an albedo that can be as high as 98%. This is for the ideal example, however: deep snow over a treeless landscape with no obstacles around. In the real world, the maximum albedo depends on the environment. Thus, even in the middle of winter with a heavy snow cover, the albedo of weather stations in the pine-forested areas from Europe to Siberia and in the Americas rarely goes above 40%, and many stations in this area have averages around 25%. Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50's in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world.


Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that the earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 11&amp;deg;C (20&amp;deg;F) colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place.

If the theory of global warming is true, and the polar regions of the planet are going to be rapidly warming up, then the magnitude and path of the warming trend will depend largely on the albedo of the earth's polar regions, and to a lesser extent on the albedo of the whole planet. Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect. But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo. If the ice were to melt, the very high-albedo ice would be replaced with some very low-albedo water, and temperatures would rise enormously, perhaps as much as 8&amp;deg;C (15&amp;deg;F), which would make the area warmer than any other area at that latitude. (This is what accounts for the unusually warm summers on the islands of Svalbard, in Norway. But Svalbard is surrounded by ocean, whereas the Davis Strait is surrounded by land, and thus has the potential to become even warmer than Svalbard.)

If the ice melted, then there would be a way for the warm waters of the Gulf Stream to penetrate deep into the Arctic, and warm spells would become increasingly frequent. This could accelerate the melting of the Arctic Ocean, a process which would feed on itself. A melted Arctic would help many people living in Arctic areas, but could possibly hurt many others living in other parts of the globe. 

In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old Soviet plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again. Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about -1&amp;deg;C (31&amp;deg;F), and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 6&amp;deg;C (42&amp;deg;F).)

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -151&amp;deg;C (-240&amp;deg;F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5.0&amp;deg;C (9&amp;deg;F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, all we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

Other scientists, noting the effect of volcanic eruptions on global temperatures, have suggested other ideas, some of which are actually practical, to stop global warming by increasing the earth's albedo. While all of these solutions are expensive and would require cooperation from powerful nations, they show that the problem of global warming is not much of a problem at all, that it can be easily controlled and eliminated by human technology. 

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 7&amp;deg;C (13&amp;deg;F) during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.</text>

The '''Albedo''' of a surface is the ratio of reflected to incoming radiation. This ratio depends on the wavelength of the light: unqualified, it usually means visible light. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 0.9; powdered [[charcoal]] has a low albedo.

The albedo of an object can be used to help determine its [[chemical]] [[composition]]. Every [[molecule]] of every substance has its own albedo, but albedo can also refer to a collection of very many objects, and can even be applied to objects of a very large scale, such as the planet [[Earth]], which has an albedo of 37-39%. 

Since albedo can greatly affect the temperature of an area, it is advantageous for people, especially in cold climates, to settle in areas where the albedo is very low, so that they can get as much warmth as possible from the [[sun]].

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is acually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) year-round. The difference would most likely be more than 17&amp;deg;C (30&amp;deg;F) if the landscape of the rainforest was [[white]] instead of dark [[green]]. As evidence for this theory, scientists have climbed to the top of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in [[Tanzania]], which is located in an area well described as &quot;steaming jungle&quot;. But Kilimanjaro's temperatures remain well below freezing all year round, despite the fact that its summit is only about 20,000 feet above sea level. Assuming that the average temperature at sea level around Kilimanjaro is about 27&amp;deg;C (81&amp;deg;F) (this is the GHCN's record of the average temperature at Dar Es Salaam, a nearby sea-level weather station), and that the temperature up the mountain slope decreases only 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1,000 feet because of the semi-moist environment, it seems that the temperature at the summit should be about 5&amp;deg;C (41&amp;deg;F), which is much warmer than the approximately -7&amp;deg;C (20&amp;deg;F) that it has been estimated that Kilimanjaro actually receives. By comparison, the [[Hawaii]]an [[volcano]] [[Mauna Loa]], which peaks at about 14,000 feet, has an annual average temperature in the GHCN of approximately 4&amp;deg;C (40&amp;deg;F), despite the fact that Hawaii is a cooler and drier environment than northern Tanzania and thus the lapse rate there would be expected to be higher, thus resulting in a colder temperature at the summit of Mauna Loa.

But there is no snow at the top of Mauna Loa to reflect back incoming solar radiation, and although the climate at the summit is very rainy, snow is relatively rare and the coldest recorded temperature is -10&amp;deg;C (14&amp;deg;F), which reduced to sea level at a rate of 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) gives 6&amp;deg;C (42&amp;deg;F), which is not much higher than the lowest temperatures recorded at other sea-level stations in Hawaii. And the average annual temperature at sea level in Hawaii is only about 23&amp;deg;C (74&amp;deg;F), and it is during the dry season a dry 25&amp;deg;C (77&amp;deg;F), so it can be seen that the lapse rate along the slope of Mauna Loa is not significantly higher than 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1000 feet, whereas on Kilimanjaro the lapse rate is almost doubled, for no logical reason.

The only possible explanation is that on Kilimanjaro, a glacier built up when the climate was colder, and that this glacier never completely melted because its extremely high albedo reflected away enough heat to keep itself cold enough not to melt, and to keep the air temperature at the summit much lower than that atop Mauna Loa. This very wide gap in temperatures, of nearly 11&amp;deg;C (20&amp;deg;F), occurs despite the fact that the skies above both mountains are very cloudy and the climate of both is very wet, so not much solar radiation reaches either summit. If Mauna Loa were completely dry, it could be expected that its temperature would be even warmer, perhaps as warm as that of Tibet at 14,000 feet in summer.

Another good example of albedo in action is Greenland. Greenland is an island covered almost completely with ice. In the winter, very little sunlight reaches Greenland, so albedo is not as important. But in the summertime, it makes a very big difference, making summertime temperatures even colder than they would normally be for a given latitude and elevation. For example, Eismitte is a weather station situated a bit south of the geographical center of the island (near 70&amp;deg;N) at an altitude of 9843 feet. The average temperature inland at 0 feet at 70&amp;deg;N in Eurasia and North America in July is about 13&amp;deg;C (55&amp;deg;F). Given a lapse rate of 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1000 feet, we could expect the July average at Eismitte to be 2&amp;deg;C (35&amp;deg;F). In fact, 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1000 feet is often an overestimate near the poles because of the unusual convective activity that causes inversions to arise there. But the actual average July temperature at Eismitte is only -12&amp;deg;C (10&amp;deg;F), and furthermore, the next warmest month is June, at only -17&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F). June being warmer than August is a clear sign that there are some outside influences on the climate, in particular that sunlight plays an unusually large role in regulating temperature, because June is the sunniest month of the year in most of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere. But we cannot ignore the fact that the temperatures in all summer months are much colder than the predicted values using the 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) lapse rate. This is obviously due to the very high albedo that Greenland's ice cap provides. Further evidence for this theory can be seen in the fact that other stations in Greenland have very low summer temperatures as well, and in fact are relatively consistent all year round with a 1&amp;deg;C (2&amp;deg;F) per 1000 feet lapse rate.

Svalbard is a group of islands extending from about 75&amp;deg;N to 80&amp;deg;N in the very warmest part of the Arctic Ocean, the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as -7&amp;deg;C (19&amp;deg;F) at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about -29&amp;deg;C (-20&amp;deg;F) but have fallen as low as -57&amp;deg;C (-70&amp;deg;F). This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.

Some parts of the Arctic Ocean are frozen over with ice all year round. These areas have the unusual distinction of experiencing heat convection coming from the ocean below as well as the air above. The temperature of the purest Arctic Ocean water is roughly -2&amp;deg;C (28&amp;deg;F) at all depths, in all seasons. The temperature of the ice above, however, is much colder because it reflects away some of the heat of the water below it. During the summertime, the upward face of the ice reflects away solar heat and prevents itself from melting completely. The ice that does melt helps keep the average July temperatures at the North Pole at about -1&amp;deg;C (31&amp;deg;F).

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than if they wear white clothes. Ironically, dark skin also serves to aggravate heat loss during the hot summer months, although the human body's blood circulation is much more powerful than the albedo effect of its skin. Thus children, much skinnier than adults, need more clothes in the wintertime to keep them warm, even if they are dark-skinned. 

There is a simple relationship between the albedo of an area of the earth's surface and its color. The lighter the color, the higher the albedo. A white substance would have an albedo of 1.00, or 100%, while a black substance would have an albedo of 0.00 or 0%. The human eye perceives green light especially well, so green substances have albedos somewhat lower than one might think. For example, the albedo of a pine forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. The ocean, because it is so deep, is even lower, at about 3.5% (the surface temperature of the ocean at the equator is allegedly over 38&amp;deg;C (100&amp;deg;F)). Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. All of these measurements were taken from Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N, but with different values for latitude and day, they would be different. The reason for this is not because of the amount of sunlight coming in, which does not change a substance's albedo, but because the actual environments would be different in summer. For example, a cultivated field may come in as high as the low 20s, depending on the crop being cultivated. Because of increased photosynthesis, all of the values for the forests and swamp lands are nearly doubled in the summer. The grassy field, however, remains at 20% regardless of season or latitude. Near the equator, particularly in rainforest areas, the soil is very black, and its albedo is very close to 0. Some shallow lakes may have albedos as high as 45% during times when the sun is striking the lake from a very acute angle, and more of its light is reflected. Alpine areas often have strange albedo values because of the unusual land formations. 

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 

Snow is the greatest source of albedo in the world, with an albedo that can be as high as 98%. This is for the ideal example, however: deep snow over a treeless landscape with no obstacles around. In the real world, the maximum albedo depends on the environment. Thus, even in the middle of winter with a heavy snow cover, the albedo of weather stations in the pine-forested areas from Europe to Siberia and in the Americas rarely goes above 40%, and many stations in this area have averages around 25%. Deciduous trees lose their leaves, and their albedos may rise to the mid-50's in winter. Open prairie climates will average around 73%, and barren tundra averages about 80%. The icecap of Antarctica will average in the high 80s; this is essentially the maximum possible albedo in the world.


Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that the earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 11&amp;deg;C (20&amp;deg;F) colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place.

If the theory of global warming is true, and the polar regions of the planet are going to be rapidly warming up, then the magnitude and path of the warming trend will depend largely on the albedo of the earth's polar regions, and to a lesser extent on the albedo of the whole planet. Because warm days in the Arctic mean heavier snowfalls, the extra snow will have a negative feedback, tending to bring temperatures down, masking the warming effect. But if the temperature rises year-round, then summers in some areas will be warm enough to melt the snow and ice completely, and thus the feedback effect in the summer will become strongly positive. For example, currently the most northern part of the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland is blocked with ice year-round, and summer temperatures are very cold even for its latitude because of the albedo. If the ice were to melt, the very high-albedo ice would be replaced with some very low-albedo water, and temperatures would rise enormously, perhaps as much as 8&amp;deg;C (15&amp;deg;F), which would make the area warmer than any other area at that latitude. (This is what accounts for the unusually warm summers on the islands of Svalbard, in Norway. But Svalbard is surrounded by ocean, whereas the Davis Strait is surrounded by land, and thus has the potential to become even warmer than Svalbard.)

If the ice melted, then there would be a way for the warm waters of the Gulf Stream to penetrate deep into the Arctic, and warm spells would become increasingly frequent. This could accelerate the melting of the Arctic Ocean, a process which would feed on itself. A melted Arctic would help many people living in Arctic areas, but could possibly hurt many others living in other parts of the globe. 

In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old Soviet plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again. Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about -1&amp;deg;C (31&amp;deg;F), and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 6&amp;deg;C (42&amp;deg;F).)

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -151&amp;deg;C (-240&amp;deg;F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5.0&amp;deg;C (9&amp;deg;F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, all we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

Other scientists, noting the effect of volcanic eruptions on global temperatures, have suggested other ideas, some of which are actually practical, to stop global warming by increasing the earth's albedo. While all of these solutions are expensive and would require cooperation from powerful nations, they show that the problem of global warming is not much of a problem at all, that it can be easily controlled and eliminated by human technology. 

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 7&amp;deg;C (13&amp;deg;F) during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.</text>

The '''Albedo''' of a surface is the ratio of reflected to incoming radiation. This ratio depends on the wavelength of the light: unqualified, it usually means visible light. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 0.9; powdered [[charcoal]] has a low albedo. The [[Earth]] has an average albedo of 37-39%. 

According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. To give another example, the entire nation of [[Belgium]], which is among the most urbanized in the world, is considerably warmer than the mostly open, unforested [[France|French]] countryside that lies to its immediate southwest, perhaps also because of albedo effects.

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is acually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) year-round (refs???).

The albedo of a pine forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the colour of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected ligh level. The ocean's albedo, because light penetrates, is even lower, at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland.

Snow albedoes can be as high as 0.98 (too high? 0.9?). This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average about 0.8.

Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place (add Hadley study of value of reforesting; albedo vs co2).

If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo feedback). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].

In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old Soviet plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again.

Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place (add Hadley study of value of reforesting; albedo vs co2).

Other scientists, noting the effect of volcanic eruptions on global temperatures, have suggested other ideas, some of which are actually practical, to stop global warming by increasing the earth's albedo.

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 7&amp;deg;C (13&amp;deg;F) during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.</text>

The '''Albedo''' of a surface is the ratio of reflected to incoming radiation. This ratio depends on the wavelength of the light: unqualified, it usually means visible light. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 0.9; powdered [[charcoal]] has a low albedo. The [[Earth]] has an average albedo of 37-39%. 

According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. To give another example, the entire nation of [[Belgium]], which is among the most urbanized in the world, is considerably warmer than the mostly open, unforested [[France|French]] countryside that lies to its immediate southwest, perhaps also because of albedo effects.

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is acually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) year-round (refs???).

Svalbard is a group of islands extending from about 75&amp;deg;N to 80&amp;deg;N in the very warmest part of the Arctic Ocean, the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as -7&amp;deg;C (19&amp;deg;F) at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about -29&amp;deg;C (-20&amp;deg;F) but have fallen as low as -57&amp;deg;C (-70&amp;deg;F). This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than if they wear white clothes. 

The albedo of a pine forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the colour of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected ligh level. The ocean's albedo, because light penetrates, is even lower, at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. [Ref for all this: Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N].

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 

Snow albedoes can be as high as 0.98 (too high? 0.9?). This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average about 0.8.


Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that the earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 11&amp;deg;C (20&amp;deg;F) colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in in the first place (add Hadley study of value of reforesting; albedo vs co2).

If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo feedback). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].

In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old Soviet plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again. Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about -1&amp;deg;C (31&amp;deg;F), and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 6&amp;deg;C (42&amp;deg;F).)

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -151&amp;deg;C (-240&amp;deg;F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5.0&amp;deg;C (9&amp;deg;F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds.

Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 

Snow albedoes can be as high as 0.98 (too high? 0.9?). This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average about 0.8.


Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool the earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that the earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 11&amp;deg;C (20&amp;deg;F) colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in the first place (add Hadley study of value of reforesting; albedo vs co2).

If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo feedback). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].

In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old Soviet plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again. Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about -1&amp;deg;C (31&amp;deg;F), and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 6&amp;deg;C (42&amp;deg;F).)

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -151&amp;deg;C (-240&amp;deg;F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5.0&amp;deg;C (9&amp;deg;F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

Other scientists that have noted the effect of volcanic eruptions on global temperatures, have suggested other ideas to stop global warming by increasing the earth's albedo.

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 7&amp;deg;C (13&amp;deg;F) during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.</text>

The '''albedo''' of a surface is the ratio of reflected to incoming radiation. This ratio depends on the wavelength of the light: unqualified, it usually means visible light. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 0.9; powdered [[charcoal]] has a low albedo. The [[Earth]] has an average albedo of 37-39%. 

According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. To give another example, the entire nation of [[Belgium]], which is among the most urbanized in the world, is considerably warmer than the mostly open, unforested [[France|French]] countryside that lies to its immediate southwest, perhaps also because of albedo effects.

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) year-round (refs???).

Svalbard is a group of islands extending from about 75&amp;deg;N to 80&amp;deg;N in the very warmest part of the Arctic Ocean, the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as -7&amp;deg;C (19&amp;deg;F) at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the Gulf Stream penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about -29&amp;deg;C (-20&amp;deg;F) but have fallen as low as -57&amp;deg;C (-70&amp;deg;F). This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than if they wear white clothes. 

The albedo of a pine forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the colour of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. The ocean's albedo, because light penetrates, is even lower, at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. [Ref for all this: Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N].

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones.

To give another example, the entire nation of [[Belgium]], which is among the most urbanized in the world, is considerably warmer than the mostly open, unforested [[France|French]] countryside that lies to its immediate southwest, perhaps also because of albedo effects.

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) year-round (refs???).

[[Svalbard]] is a group of islands extending from about 75&amp;deg;N to 80&amp;deg;N in the very warmest part of the [[Arctic Ocean]], the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as -7&amp;deg;C (19&amp;deg;F) at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the [[Gulf Stream]] penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about -29&amp;deg;C (-20&amp;deg;F) but have fallen as low as -57&amp;deg;C (-70&amp;deg;F). This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than if they wear white clothes. 

The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the colour of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. The ocean's albedo, because light penetrates, is even lower, at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]] or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. [Ref for all this: Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N].

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 

Snow albedos can be as high as 0.9. This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 0.8.

Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool Earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that Earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 11&amp;deg;C (20&amp;deg;F) colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in the first place (add Hadley study of value of reforesting; albedo vs co2).

If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo feedback). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].

In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again. Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about -1&amp;deg;C (31&amp;deg;F), and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 6&amp;deg;C (42&amp;deg;F).)

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s (source?). Climate models  (which?) have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -151&amp;deg;C (-240&amp;deg;F). This model (is it singular now? they were plural above...), though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5.0&amp;deg;C (9&amp;deg;F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 7&amp;deg;C (13&amp;deg;F) during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.

Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about -1&amp;deg;C (31&amp;deg;F), and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 6&amp;deg;C (42&amp;deg;F).)

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s (source?). Climate models  (which?) have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -151&amp;deg;C (-240&amp;deg;F). This model (is it singular now? they were plural above...), though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5.0&amp;deg;C (9&amp;deg;F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 7&amp;deg;C (13&amp;deg;F) during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[climatology]], the '''albedo''' of a surface is the ratio of reflected to incoming radiation. This ratio depends on the wavelength of the light: unqualified, it usually means [[visible light]]. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 90%. Powdered [[charcoal]] has a low albedo. [[Earth]] has an average albedo of 37-39%. 

According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. To give another example, the entire nation of [[Belgium]], which is among the most urbanized in the world, is considerably warmer than the mostly open, unforested [[France|French]] countryside that lies to its immediate southwest, perhaps also because of albedo effects.

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) year-round (refs???).

[[Svalbard]] is a group of islands extending from about 75&amp;deg;N to 80&amp;deg;N in the very warmest part of the [[Arctic Ocean]], the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as -7&amp;deg;C (19&amp;deg;F) at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the [[Gulf Stream]] penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about -29&amp;deg;C (-20&amp;deg;F) but have fallen as low as -57&amp;deg;C (-70&amp;deg;F). This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than if they wear white clothes. 

The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the colour of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. The ocean's albedo, because light penetrates, is even lower, at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]] or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. [Ref for all this: Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N].

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 

Snow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.

Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool Earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that Earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 11&amp;deg;C (20&amp;deg;F) colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in the first place (add Hadley study of value of reforesting; albedo vs co2).

If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo feedback). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].

In fact, those few remaining supporters of the old [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] plan to melt the Arctic Ocean rest their arguments largely on the fact that once the ocean is melted, temperatures there would never become cold enough for the ice to build up again. Their theory is probably false, as climate models have shown that temperatures would still be below freezing for most of the year, and then, because of albedo, would soon be below freezing all year because the ice would remain throughout the summer. (The average temperature at the North Pole in July is estimated to be about -1&amp;deg;C (31&amp;deg;F), and it is estimated that without an icecap that July would average around 6&amp;deg;C (42&amp;deg;F).)

== Some examples of albedo effects ==

=== Fairbanks, Alaska ===

According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. To give another example, the entire nation of [[Belgium]], which is among the most urbanized in the world, is considerably warmer than the mostly open, unforested [[France|French]] countryside that lies to its immediate southwest, perhaps also because of albedo effects.

=== The tropics ===

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) year-round.

=== Svalbard ===

[[Svalbard]] is a group of islands extending from about 75&amp;deg;N to 80&amp;deg;N in the very warmest part of the [[Arctic Ocean]], the part that is bathed by the long stream of warm water coming from the Caribbean. In the wintertime, the coastline of most of the island remains free from ice, which gives towns on the most prominent headlands incredibly warm winters, with temperatures averaging as high as -7&amp;deg;C (19&amp;deg;F) at one weather station. But just a very short distance away, the northeastern part of the island often does freeze over. And here, the winter climate is a beautifully unstable oscillation between the very furthest reaches of the [[Gulf Stream]] penetration and the featureless cold Arctic winter. Temperatures in the northeast average about -29&amp;deg;C (-20&amp;deg;F) but have fallen as low as -57&amp;deg;C (-70&amp;deg;F). This would be unheard of in the ice-free areas of the islands.

=== Small scale effects ===

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than if they wear white clothes. 

=== Pine forests ===

The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the colour of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. The ocean's albedo, because light penetrates, is even lower, at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]] or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. [Ref for all this: Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N].

=== Urban areas ===

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. 

=== Trees ===

Because trees are such strong absorbers of heat, it seems logical that removing forests would tend to cool Earth as a whole. This is an extremely complex subject, and there are large amounts of evidence both for and against this view. Some reasons that it may not be true are the fact that in tropical parts of the world, the soil underneath trees often absorbs more heat than the trees themselves, that forested areas tend to have higher cloud cover, and thus reflect away more heat anyway, and the belief that Earth is regulating its own temperature, and thus that deforestation has essentially no lasting effect on global temperature. But the fact remains that tree-free environments where deep snow covers the ground during the winter have winter albedos 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas, and temperatures in the middle latitudes are as much as 11&amp;deg;C (20&amp;deg;F) colder over the barrens. Near the poles, the difference approaches zero because less sunlight is coming in the first place (add Hadley study of value of reforesting; albedo vs co2).

=== Snow ===

Snow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.

If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo feedback). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].


=== Clouds ===

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -151&amp;deg;C (-240&amp;deg;F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5.0&amp;deg;C (9&amp;deg;F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

=== Kuwait fires ===

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 7&amp;deg;C (13&amp;deg;F) during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.

The '''albedo''' of a surface is the ratio of reflected to incoming radiation and is an important concept in [[climatology]]. This ratio depends on the wavelength of the light: unqualified, it usually means [[visible light]]. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo. [[Earth]] has an average albedo of 37-39%.

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global warming]].

The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo increases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of insolation; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.


== Some examples of albedo effects ==

=== Fairbanks, Alaska ===

According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. 

=== The tropics ===

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) year-round.

They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming [http://66.102.11.104/search?q=cache:o7LD-owSkNgJ:www.ulapland.fi/home/arktinen/feed_pdf/Betts_revised.pdf+hadley+albedo+forest&amp;hl=en].

The '''albedo''' of a surface is the ratio of reflected to incoming radiation and is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]]. This ratio, varying from 0% to 100%, is measured by illuminating a surface at normal incidence and  depends on the range of frequencies of the light considered: unqualified, it refers to the spectrum of [[visible light]]. Typical values vary greatly ranging from nearly 100% for fresh snow to 4% for charcoal. The ocean surface has a low albedo. [[Earth]] has an average albedo of 37-39%.

The '''albedo''' is a measure of reflectivity of a surface or body. It is the ratio of electromagnetic radiation reflected to the amount incident upon it (determined for vertically incident radiation). The fraction, usually expressed as a percentage ranges from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the range of frequencies of the light considered: unqualified, it refers to the spectrum of [[visible light]]. Typical values vary greatly ranging from nearly 100% for fresh snow to 4% for charcoal. The ocean surface has a low albedo. [[Earth]] has an average albedo of 37-39% whereas the albedo of the moon is about 12%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and asteroids can be used to infer their surface composition, most notably its ice content.  

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global warming]].

The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo increases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of insolation; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.


== Some examples of albedo effects ==

=== Fairbanks, Alaska ===

According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. 

=== The tropics ===

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) year-round.

=== Small scale effects ===

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than if they wear white clothes. 

=== Pine forests ===

The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the colour of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. The ocean's albedo, because light penetrates, is even lower, at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]] or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. [Ref for all this: Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N].

=== Urban areas ===

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials.

=== Trees ===

Because trees tend to have a low albedo removing forests would tend to warm Earth. However, in tropical parts of the world, the soil may have a lower albedo than the trees themselves (really?). Cloud feedbacks further complication the issue. In seasonally snow covered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snows does not cover the trees as readily.

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming [http://66.102.11.104/search?q=cache:o7LD-owSkNgJ:www.ulapland.fi/home/arktinen/feed_pdf/Betts_revised.pdf+hadley+albedo+forest&amp;hl=en].

=== Snow ===

Snow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.

If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo feedback). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].


=== Clouds ===

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -151&amp;deg;C (-240&amp;deg;F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5.0&amp;deg;C (9&amp;deg;F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

=== Kuwait fires ===

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 7&amp;deg;C (13&amp;deg;F) during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.

The '''albedo''' is a measure of reflectivity of a surface or body. It is the ratio of electromagnetic radiation reflected to the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the frequency of the radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the angle of incidence of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo. [[Earth]] has an average albedo of 37-39% whereas the albedo of the moon is about 12%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and asteroids can be used to infer their surface composition, most notably its ice content.  

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global warming]].

''Note: This article discusses the physical or planetological property of albedo. For other usage, see [[Albedo (disambiguation)]].''

The '''albedo''' is a measure of reflectivity of a surface or body. It is the ratio of electromagnetic radiation reflected to the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the frequency of the radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the angle of incidence of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo. [[Earth]] has an average albedo of 37-39% whereas the albedo of the moon is about 12%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and asteroids can be used to infer their surface composition, most notably its ice content.  

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global warming]].

The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo increases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of insolation; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.


== Some examples of albedo effects ==

=== Fairbanks, Alaska ===

According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. 

=== The tropics ===

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) year-round.

=== Small scale effects ===

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than if they wear white clothes. 

=== Pine forests ===

The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the colour of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. The ocean's albedo, because light penetrates, is even lower, at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]] or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. [Ref for all this: Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N].

=== Urban areas ===

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials.

=== Trees ===

Because trees tend to have a low albedo removing forests would tend to warm Earth. However, in tropical parts of the world, the soil may have a lower albedo than the trees themselves (really?). Cloud feedbacks further complication the issue. In seasonally snow covered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snows does not cover the trees as readily.

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming [http://66.102.11.104/search?q=cache:o7LD-owSkNgJ:www.ulapland.fi/home/arktinen/feed_pdf/Betts_revised.pdf+hadley+albedo+forest&amp;hl=en].

=== Snow ===

Snow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.

If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo feedback). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].


=== Clouds ===

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -151&amp;deg;C (-240&amp;deg;F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5.0&amp;deg;C (9&amp;deg;F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

=== Kuwait fires ===

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 7&amp;deg;C (13&amp;deg;F) during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming [http://66.102.11.104/search?q=cache:o7LD-owSkNgJ:www.ulapland.fi/home/arktinen/feed_pdf/Betts_revised.pdf+hadley+albedo+forest&amp;hl=en].

=== Snow ===

Snow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.

If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo feedback). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].


=== Clouds ===

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -151&amp;deg;C (-240&amp;deg;F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5.0&amp;deg;C (9&amp;deg;F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

=== Kuwait fires ===

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 7&amp;deg;C (13&amp;deg;F) during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.

''Note: This article discusses the physical or planetological property of albedo. For other usage, see [[Albedo (disambiguation)]].''

The '''albedo''' is a measure of reflectivity of a surface or body. It is the ratio of electromagnetic radiation reflected to the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the frequency of the radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the angle of incidence of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo. [[Earth]] has an average albedo of 37-39% whereas the albedo of the moon is about 12%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and asteroids can be used to infer their surface composition, most notably its ice content.  

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global warming]].

The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo increases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of insolation; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.


== Some examples of albedo effects ==

=== Fairbanks, Alaska ===

According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. 

=== The tropics ===

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 3&amp;deg;C (5&amp;deg;F) year-round.

=== Small scale effects ===

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than if they wear white clothes. 

=== Pine forests ===

The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45&amp;deg;N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. The ocean's albedo, because light penetrates, is even lower, at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]] or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. [Ref for all this: Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45&amp;deg;N].

=== Urban areas ===

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials.

=== Trees ===

Because trees tend to have a low albedo removing forests would tend to warm Earth. However, in tropical parts of the world, the soil may have a lower albedo than the trees themselves (really?). Cloud feedbacks further complication the issue. In seasonally snow covered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snows does not cover the trees as readily.

When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 3°C (5°F) year-round.

=== Small scale effects ===

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than if they wear white clothes. 

=== Pine forests ===

The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. The ocean's albedo, because light penetrates, is even lower, at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]] or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. [Ref for all this: Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45°N].

=== Urban areas ===

=== Trees ===

Because trees tend to have a low albedo removing forests would tend to warm Earth. However, in tropical parts of the world, the soil may have a lower albedo than the trees themselves (really?). Cloud feedbacks further complication the issue. In seasonally snow covered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snows does not cover the trees as readily.

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming [http://66.102.11.104/search?q=cache:o7LD-owSkNgJ:www.ulapland.fi/home/arktinen/feed_pdf/Betts_revised.pdf+hadley+albedo+forest&amp;hl=en].

=== Snow ===

Snow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.

If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo feedback). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].

=== Clouds ===

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -151°C (-240°F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5.0°C (9°F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

=== Kuwait fires ===

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 7°C (13°F) during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.

''Note: This article discusses the physical or planetological property of albedo. For other usage, see [[Albedo (disambiguation)]].''

The '''albedo''' is a measure of reflectivity of a surface or body. It is the ratio of electromagnetic radiation reflected to the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the frequency of the radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the angle of incidence of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo. [[Earth]] has an average albedo of 37-39% whereas the albedo of the moon is about 12%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and asteroids can be used to infer their surface composition, most notably its ice content.  

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global warming]].

The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo increases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of insolation; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.

== Some examples of albedo effects ==

=== Fairbanks, Alaska ===

According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3°C (5°F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater.

=== Urban areas ===

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials.

=== Trees ===

Because trees tend to have a low albedo removing forests would tend to warm Earth. However, in tropical parts of the world, the soil may have a lower albedo than the trees themselves (really?).

The ocean's albedo, because light penetrates, is even lower, at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]] or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. [Ref for all this: Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45°N].

=== Urban areas ===

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials.

=== Trees ===

Because trees tend to have a low albedo removing forests would tend to warm Earth. However, in tropical parts of the world, the soil may have a lower albedo than the trees themselves (really?). Cloud feedbacks further complication the issue. In seasonally snow covered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snows does not cover the trees as readily.

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming [http://66.102.11.104/search?q=cache:o7LD-owSkNgJ:www.ulapland.fi/home/arktinen/feed_pdf/Betts_revised.pdf+hadley+albedo+forest&amp;hl=en].

=== Snow ===

Snow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.

If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo feedback). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].

=== Clouds ===

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -151°C (-240°F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5.0°C (9°F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

=== Kuwait fires ===

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 7°C (13°F) during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.

''Note: This article discusses the physical or planetological property of albedo. For other usage, see [[Albedo (disambiguation)]].''

The '''albedo''' is a measure of reflectivity of a surface or body. It is the ratio of electromagnetic radiation reflected to the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the frequency of the radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the angle of incidence of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. 

[http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~js/glossary/albedo.html]
Albedo is the fraction of light that is reflected by a body or surface. It is commonly used in astronomy to describe the reflective properties of planets, satellites, and asteroids.

Albedo is usually differentiated into two general types: normal albedo and bond albedo. The former, also called normal reflectance, is a measure of a surface's relative brightness when illuminated and observed vertically. The normal albedo of snow, for example, is nearly 1.0, whereas that of charcoal is about 0.04. Investigators frequently rely on observations of normal albedo to determine the surface compositions of satellites and asteroids.


The ocean surface has a low albedo. [[Earth]] has an average albedo of 37-39% whereas the moon has a lower albedo is about 12% due to the lack of cloud cover. 

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global warming]].   A lower albedo over time could be an indicator of global warming.  However, the loss of heat (infrared radiation) from the earth to space also has to be considered.
== Some examples of albedo effects ==

=== Fairbanks, Alaska ===

According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3°C (5°F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. 

=== The tropics ===

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 3°C (5°F) year-round.

=== Small scale effects ===

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than if they wear white clothes. 

=== Pine forests ===

The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level.

The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo increases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of insolation; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.

It also depends on the angle of incidence of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo. [[Earth]] has an average albedo of 37-39% whereas the albedo of the moon is about 12%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and asteroids can be used to infer their surface composition, most notably its ice content.  

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global warming]].

The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo increases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of insolation; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.

== Some examples of albedo effects ==

=== Fairbanks, Alaska ===

According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3°C (5°F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. 

=== The tropics ===

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 3°C (5°F) year-round.

=== Small scale effects ===

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than if they wear white clothes. 

=== Pine forests ===

The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. The ocean's albedo, because light penetrates, is even lower, at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]] or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. [Ref for all this: Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45°N].

=== Urban areas ===

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials.

=== Trees ===

Because trees tend to have a low albedo removing forests would tend to warm Earth. However, in tropical parts of the world, the soil may have a lower albedo than the trees themselves. Cloud feedbacks further complication the issue. In seasonally snow covered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily.

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming [http://66.102.11.104/search?q=cache:o7LD-owSkNgJ:www.ulapland.fi/home/arktinen/feed_pdf/Betts_revised.pdf+hadley+albedo+forest&amp;hl=en].

=== Snow ===

Snow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.

If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo feedback). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].

=== Clouds ===

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -151°C (-240°F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5.0°C (9°F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds. 

=== Kuwait fires ===

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 7°C (13°F) during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.

A study following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]], after which all major airlines in the U.S. shut down for 3 days, showed a 1&amp;deg;C increase in day temperatures and a 1&amp;deg;C decrease in night temperatures in such an area.

Albedo and climate in some areas are already affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic. A study following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]], after which all major airlines in the U.S. shut down for three days, showed a 1&amp;deg;C increase in day temperatures and a 1&amp;deg;C decrease in night temperatures in such an area.

=== Kuwait fires ===

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 7°C (13°F) during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Note: This article discusses the physical or planetological property of albedo. For other usage, see [[Albedo (disambiguation)]].''

The '''albedo''' is a measure of reflectivity of a surface or body. It is the ratio of electromagnetic radiation reflected to the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the frequency of the radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the angle of incidence of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo. [[Earth]] has an average albedo of 37-39% whereas the albedo of the moon is about 12%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and asteroids can be used to infer their surface composition, most notably its ice content.  

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global warming]].

The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo increases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of insolation; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.

== Some examples of albedo effects ==

=== Fairbanks, Alaska ===

According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3°C (5°F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. 

=== The tropics ===

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 3°C (5°F) year-round.

=== Small scale effects ===

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than if they wear white clothes. 

=== Pine forests ===

The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. The ocean's albedo, because light penetrates, is even lower, at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]] or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. [Ref for all this: Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45°N].

=== Urban areas ===

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials.

=== Trees ===

Because trees tend to have a low albedo removing forests would tend to warm Earth. Cloud feedbacks further complication the issue. In seasonally snow covered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily.

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming [http://66.102.11.104/search?q=cache:o7LD-owSkNgJ:www.ulapland.fi/home/arktinen/feed_pdf/Betts_revised.pdf+hadley+albedo+forest&amp;hl=en].

=== Snow ===

Snow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.

If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo feedback). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].

=== Clouds ===

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -151°C (-240°F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5.0°C (9°F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds.

=== Small scale effects ===

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than if they wear white clothes. 

=== Pine forests ===

The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. The ocean's albedo, because light penetrates, is even lower, at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]] or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. [Ref for all this: Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45°N].

=== Urban areas ===

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials.

=== Trees ===

Because trees tend to have a low albedo removing forests would tend to warm Earth. Cloud feedbacks further complication the issue. In seasonally snow covered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily.

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming [http://66.102.11.104/search?q=cache:o7LD-owSkNgJ:www.ulapland.fi/home/arktinen/feed_pdf/Betts_revised.pdf+hadley+albedo+forest&amp;hl=en].

=== Snow ===

Snow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.

If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo feedback). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].

=== Clouds ===

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -151°C (-240°F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5.0°C (9°F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds.

Albedo and climate in some areas are already affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic. A study following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]], after which all major airlines in the U.S. shut down for three days, showed a local 1&amp;deg;C increase in the diurnal temperature range (the difference of day and night temperatures) (''see: [[contrail]]'').

=== Kuwait fires ===

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 7°C (13°F) during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.

The '''albedo''' is a measure of reflectivity of a surface or body. It is the ratio of electromagnetic radiation reflected to the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the frequency of the radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the angle of incidence of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo. [[Earth]] has an average albedo of 37-39% whereas the albedo of the moon is about 12%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and asteroids can be used to infer their surface composition, most notably its ice content.  

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global warming]].

The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo increases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.

== Some examples of albedo effects ==

=== Fairbanks, Alaska ===

According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3°C (5°F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. 

=== The tropics ===

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Note: This article discusses the physical or planetological property of albedo. For other usage, see [[Albedo (disambiguation)]].''

The '''albedo''' is a measure of reflectivity of a surface or body. It is the ratio of electromagnetic radiation reflected to the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the frequency of the radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the angle of incidence of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo. [[Earth]] has an average albedo of 37-39% whereas the albedo of the moon is about 12%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and asteroids can be used to infer their surface composition, most notably its ice content.  

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global warming]].

The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo increases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.

== Some examples of albedo effects ==

=== Fairbanks, Alaska ===

According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3°C (5°F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. 

=== The tropics ===

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 3°C (5°F) year-round.

=== Small scale effects ===

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than if they wear white clothes. 

=== Pine forests ===

The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. The ocean's albedo, because light penetrates, is even lower, at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]] or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. [Ref for all this: Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45°N].

=== Urban areas ===

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials.

=== Trees ===

Because trees tend to have a low albedo, removing forests would tend to warm the planet. Cloud feedbacks further complicate the issue. In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily.

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming [http://66.102.11.104/search?q=cache:o7LD-owSkNgJ:www.ulapland.fi/home/arktinen/feed_pdf/Betts_revised.pdf+hadley+albedo+forest&amp;hl=en].

=== Snow ===

Snow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.

If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo feedback). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].

=== Clouds ===

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -151°C (-240°F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5.0°C (9°F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds.

Albedo and climate in some areas are already affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic. A study following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]], after which all major airlines in the U.S. shut down for three days, showed a local 1&amp;deg;C increase in the diurnal temperature range (the difference of day and night temperatures) (''see: [[contrail]]'').

=== Kuwait fires ===

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 7°C (13°F) during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.

Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials.

=== Trees ===

Because trees tend to have a low albedo, removing forests would tend to warm the planet. Cloud feedbacks further complicate the issue. In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily.

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming [http://66.102.11.104/search?q=cache:o7LD-owSkNgJ:www.ulapland.fi/home/arktinen/feed_pdf/Betts_revised.pdf+hadley+albedo+forest&amp;hl=en].

=== Snow ===

Snow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.

If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo feedback). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].

=== Clouds ===

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -151°C (-240°F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5.0°C (9°F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds.

Albedo and climate in some areas are already affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic. A study following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]], after which all major airlines in the U.S. shut down for three days, showed a local 1&amp;deg;C increase in the diurnal temperature range (the difference of day and night temperatures) (''see: [[contrail]]'').

=== Kuwait fires ===

It is unknown, however, whether injecting dark-colored particles into the atmosphere would have a conversely warming effect. During the [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] in 1991, temperatures in the usually hot desert kingdom cooled down by an average of 7°C (13°F) during the period of greatest obstruction. Thus it may be impossible to warm the planet in a controlled way by clouding up the atmosphere with dark-colored materials, and thereby reflecting less heat back into space.

The '''albedo''' is a measure of reflectivity of a surface or body. It is the ratio of electromagnetic radiation reflected to the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the frequency of the radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the angle of incidence of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo. [[Earth]] has an average albedo of 37-39% whereas the albedo of the moon is about 12%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and asteroids can be used to infer their surface composition, most notably its ice content.  

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global warming]].

The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.

== Some examples of albedo effects ==

=== Fairbanks, Alaska ===

According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3°C (5°F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. 

=== The tropics ===

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 3°C (5°F) year-round.

=== Small scale effects ===

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than if they wear white clothes. 

=== Pine forests ===

The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. The ocean's albedo, because light penetrates, is even lower, at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]] or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. [Ref for all this: Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45°N].

=== Urban areas ===

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials.

=== Aerosol effects ===

[[Aerosol]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) has two effects, direct and indirect. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[CCN]]s and thereby change cloud properties]] is less certain [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671].

=== Black carbon ===

Another albedo-related effect on the cliamte is from black carbon particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[IPCC]] say that their: ''estimate of the global mean radiative forcing for BC aerosols from fossil fuels is ... +0.2 Wm-2 (from +0.1 Wm-2) with a range +0.1 to +0.4 Wm-2'' [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm].

The '''albedo''' is a measure of reflectivity of a surface or body. It is the ratio of [[electromagnetic radiation]] reflected to the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]]. This ratio depends on the [[frequency]] of the radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. It also depends on the angle of incidence of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo. [[Earth]] has an average albedo of 37-39% whereas the albedo of the [[Moon]] is about 12%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and asteroids can be used to infer their surface composition, most notably its ice content.  

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global warming]].

The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.

== Some examples of albedo effects ==

=== Fairbanks, Alaska ===

According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is about 3°C (5°F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[pine tree| pine]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when solar radiation is greater. 

=== The tropics ===

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area allegedly increases by an average of about 3°C (5°F) year-round.

=== Small scale effects ===

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than if they wear white clothes. 

=== Pine forests ===

The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. The ocean's albedo, because light penetrates, is even lower, at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]] or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. [Ref for all this: Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45°N].

=== Urban areas ===

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials.

=== Trees ===

Because trees tend to have a low albedo, removing forests would tend to warm the planet. Cloud feedbacks further complicate the issue. In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily.

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming [http://66.102.11.104/search?q=cache:o7LD-owSkNgJ:www.ulapland.fi/home/arktinen/feed_pdf/Betts_revised.pdf+hadley+albedo+forest&amp;hl=en].

=== Snow ===

Snow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.

If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo feedback). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].

=== Clouds ===

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models have shown that if the whole earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -151°C (-240°F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5.0°C (9°F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the earth's overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds.

Albedo and climate in some areas are already affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic. A study following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]], after which all major airlines in the U.S. shut down for three days, showed a local 1&amp;deg;C increase in the diurnal temperature range (the difference of day and night temperatures) (''see: [[contrail]]'').

=== Aerosol effects ===

[[Aerosol]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) has two effects, direct and indirect. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[CCN]]s and thereby change [[cloud properties]]) is less certain [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671].

=== Black carbon ===

Another albedo-related effect on the cliamte is from black carbon particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[IPCC]] say that their: ''estimate of the global mean radiative forcing for BC aerosols from fossil fuels is ... +0.2 Wm-2 (from +0.1 Wm-2 in the [[SAR]]) with a range +0.1 to +0.4 Wm-2'' [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm].
